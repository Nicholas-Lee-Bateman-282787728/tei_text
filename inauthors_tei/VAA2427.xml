                    <head>I</head>
                    <p>M<hi rend="sc">R.</hi> H<hi rend="sc">OWELLS</hi> once said to me: "Every
                        man's life is interestingto himself."</p>
                    <p>I suppose that is true, though in the cases of some men it seems a difficult
                        thing to understand.</p>
                    <p>At any rate it is not because of personal interest in my own life that I am
                        writing this book. I was perfectly sincere in wanting to call these chapters
                        "The Autobiography of an Unimportant Man," but on reflection I remembered
                        Franklin's wise saying that whenever he saw the phrase "without vanity I may
                        say," some peculiarly vain thing was sure to follow.</p>
                    <p>I am seventy years old. My life has been one of unusually varied activity. It
                        has covered half the period embraced in the republic's existence. It has
                        afforded me opportunity to see and share that development of physical,
                        intellectual, and moral life conditions, which has been perhaps the most
                        marvelous recorded in the history of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally to the varied activities and accidents of my life, I have been
                        brought into contact with many interesting men, and into relation with many
                        interesting events. It is of these chiefly that I wish to write, and if I
                        were minded to offer an excuse for this book's existence, this would be the
                        marrow of it. But a book that needs excuse is inexcusable. I make no
                        apology. I am writing of the men and things I remember, because I <pb
                            id="VAA2427-011" n="2"/> wish to do so, because my publisher wishes it,
                        and because he and I think that others will be interested in the result. We
                        shall see, later, how that is.</p>
                    <p>This will be altogether a good-humored book. I have no grudges to gratify, no
                        revenges to wreak, no debts of wrath to repay in cowardly ways; and if I had
                        I should put them all aside as unworthy. I have found my fellowmen in the
                        main kindly, just, and generous. The chief pleasure I have had in living has
                        been derived from my association with them in good-fellowship and all
                        kindliness. The very few of them who have wronged me, I have forgiven. The
                        few who have been offensive to me, I have forgotten, with conscientiously
                        diligent care. There has seemed to me no better thing to do with them.</p>

                    <head>II</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> is difficult for any one belonging to this modern time
                        to realize the conditions of life in this country in the eighteen-forties,
                        the period at which my recollection begins.</p>
                    <p>The country at that time was all American. The great tides of immigration
                        which have since made it the most cosmopolitan of countries, had not set in.
                        Foreigners among us were so few that they were regarded with a great deal of
                        curiosity, some contempt, and not a little pity. Even in places like my
                        native town of Vevay, Indiana, which had been settled by a company of Swiss
                        immigrants at the beginning of the century, the feeling was strong that to
                        be foreign was to be inferior. Those who survived of the original Swiss
                        settlers were generously tolerated as unfortunates grown old, and on that
                        account entitled to a certain measure of respectful deference in spite of
                        their taint.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-012" n="3"/>
                    <p>To us in the West, at least, all foreigners whose mother tongue was other
                        than English were " Dutchmen." There is reason to believe that this careless
                        and inattentive grouping prevailed in other parts of the country as well as
                        in the West. Why, otherwise, were the German speaking people of Pennsylvania
                        and the mountain regions south universally known as " Pennsylvania
                        Dutch?"</p>
                    <p>And yet, in spite of the prevailing conviction that everything foreign was
                        inferior, the people of the Ohio valley-who constituted the most
                        considerable group of Western Americans-looked with unapproving but ardent
                        admiration upon foreign life, manners, and ways of thinking as these were
                        exemplified in New Orleans.</p>
                    <p>In that early time, when the absence of bridges, the badness of roads, and
                        the primitive character of vehicular devices so greatly emphasized overland
                        distances, New Orleans was the one great outlet and inlet of travel and
                        traffic for all the region beyond the mountain barrier that made the East
                        seem as remote as far Cathay, Thither the people of the West sent the
                        produce of their orchards and their fields to find a market; thence came the
                        goods sold in the "stores," and the very money-Spanish and French silver
                        coins-that served as a circulating medium. The men who annually voyaged
                        thither on flat-boats, brought back wondering tales of the strange things
                        seen there, and especially of the enormous wickedness encountered among a
                        people who had scarcely heard of the religious views accepted among
                        ourselves as unquestioned and unquestionable truth. I remember hearing a
                        whole sermon on the subject once. The preacher had taken alarm over the
                        eagerness young men showed to secure employment as "hands" on flat-boats for
                        the sake of seeing the wonderful city where buying and selling on the
                        Sabbath excited no comment. He feared contamination of the youth of the
                        land, and with a zeal that perhaps <pb id="VAA2427-013" n="4"/> outran
                        discretion, he urged God-fearing merchants to abandon the business of
                        shipping the country's produce to market, declaring that he had rather see
                        all of it go to waste than risk the loss of a single young man's soul by
                        sending him to a city so unspeakably wicked that he confidently expected
                        early news of its destruction after the manner of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
                    <p>The "power of preaching" was well-nigh measureless in that time and region,
                        but so were the impulses of "business," and I believe the usual number of
                        flat-boats were sent out from the little town that year. The merchants
                        seemed to "take chances" of the loss of souls when certain gain was the
                        stake on the other side, a fact which strongly suggests that human nature in
                        that time and country was very much the same in its essentials as human
                        nature in all other times and countries.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> remoteness of the different parts of the country from
                        each other in those days is difficult to understand, or even fairly to
                        imagine nowadays. For all purposes of civilization remoteness is properly
                        measured, not by miles, but by the difficulty of travel and intercourse. It
                        was in recognition of this that the founders of the Republic gave to
                        Congress authority to establish " post offices and post roads," and that
                        their successors lavished money upon endeavor to render human intercourse
                        easier, speedier, and cheaper by the construction of the national road, by
                        the digging of canals, and by efforts to improve the postal service. In my
                        early boyhood none of these things had come upon us. There were no railroads
                        crossing the Appalachian chain of mountains, and no wagon roads that were
                        better than tracks over ungraded hills and quagmire <pb id="VAA2427-014"
                            n="5"/> trails through swamps and morasses. Measured by ease of access,
                        New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore were at a greater distance from the
                        dwellers in the West than Hong Kong or Singapore is now, while Boston was
                        remoter than the mountains of the moon.</p>
                    <p>There were no telegraphs available to us; the mails were irregular,
                        uncertain, and unsafe. The wagons, called stagecoaches, that carried them,
                        were subject to capture and looting at the hands of robber bands who
                        infested many parts of the country, having their headquarters usually at
                        some town where roads converged and lawlessness reigned supreme.</p>
                    <p>One such town was Napoleon, Indiana. In illustration of its character an
                        anecdote was related in my boyhood. A man from the East made inquiry in
                        Cincinnati concerning routes to various points in the Hoosier State, and
                        beyond.</p>
                    <p>"If I want to go to Indianapolis, what road do I take ? " he asked.</p>
                    <p>"Why, you go to Napoleon, and take the road north-west."</p>
                    <p>"If I want to go to Madison?"</p>
                    <p>"Go to Napoleon, and take the road southwest."</p>
                    <p>"Suppose I want to go to St. Louis?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, you go to Napoleon, and take the national road west."</p>
                    <p>And so on, through a long list, with Napoleon as the starting point of each
                        reply. At last the man asked in despair:</p>
                    <p>"Well now, stranger, suppose I wanted to go to Hell?"</p>
                    <p>The stranger answered without a moment's hesitation, "Oh, in that case, just
                        go to Napoleon, and stay there."</p>
                    <p>That is an episode, as the reader has probably discovered. <pb
                            id="VAA2427-015" n="6"/> To return to the mails. It was not until 1845,
                        and after long agitation, that the rate on letters was reduced to five cents
                        for distances less than three hundred miles, and ten cents for greater
                        distances. Newspaper postage was relatively even higher.</p>
                    <p>The result of these conditions was that each quarter of the country was shut
                        out from everything like free communication with the other quarters. Each
                        section was isolated. Each was left to work out its own salvation as best it
                        might, without aid, without consultation, without the chastening or the
                        stimulation of contact and attrition. Each region cherished its own
                        prejudices, its own dialect, its own ways of living, its own overweening
                        self-consciousness of superiority to all the rest, its own narrow bigotries,
                        and its own suspicious contempt of everything foreign to itself.</p>
                    <p>In brief, we had no national life in the eighteen-forties, or for long
                        afterwards,no community of thought, or custom, or attitude of mind. The
                        several parts of the country were a loose bundle of segregated and, in many
                        ways, antagonistic communities, bound together only by a common loyalty to
                        the conviction that this was the greatest, most glorious, most invincible
                        country in the world, God-endowed with a mental, moral, and physical
                        superiority that put all the rest of earth's nations completely cut of the
                        reckoning. We were all of us Americansintense, self-satisfied,
                        self-glorifying Americansbut we had little else in common. We did not know
                        each other. We had been bred in radically different ways. We had different
                        ideals, different conceptions of life, different standards of conduct,
                        different ways of living, different traditions, and different aspirations.
                        The country was provincial to the rest of the world, and still more narrowly
                        provincial each region to the others.</p>

                    <head>IV</head>
                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">THINK</hi>, however, that the West was less provincial,
                        probably, and less narrow in its views and sympathies than were New England,
                        the Middle States, and the South at that time, and this for a very
                        sufficient reason.</p>
                    <p>The people in New England rarely came into contact with those of the Middle
                        and Southern States, and never with those of the West. The people of the
                        Middle States and those of the South were similarly shut within themselves,
                        having scarcely more than an imaginary acquaintance with the dwellers in
                        other parts of the country. The West was a common meeting ground where men
                        from New England, the Middle States, and the South Atlantic region
                        constituted a varied population, representative of all the rest of the
                        country, and dwelling together in so close a unity that each group adopted
                        many of the ways and ideas of the other groups, and correspondingly modified
                        its own. These were first steps taken toward homogeneity in the West, such
                        as were taken in no other part of the country in that time of little travel
                        and scanty intercourse among men. The Virginians, Carolinians, and New
                        Englanders who had migrated to the West learned to make and appreciate the
                        apple butter and the sauerkraut of the Pennsylvanians; the pie of New
                        England found favor with Southerners in return for their hoecake, hominy,
                        chine, and spareribs. And as with material things, so also with things of
                        the mind. Customs were blended, usages were borrowed and modified, opinions
                        were fused together into new forms, and speech was wrought into something
                        different from that which any one group had knowna blend, better, richer,
                        and more forcible than any of its constituent parts had been.</p>
                    <p>In numbers the Virginians, Kentuckians, and Carolinians <pb id="VAA2427-017"
                            n="8"/> were a strong majority in the West, and the so-called "Hoosier
                        dialect," which prevailed there, was nearly identical with that of the
                        Virginian mountains, Kentucky, and the rural parts of Carolina. But it was
                        enriched with many terms and forms of speech belonging to other sections.
                        Better still, it was chastened by the influence of the small but very
                        influential company of educated men and women who had come from Virginia and
                        Kentucky, and by the strenuous labors in behalf of good English of the
                        Yankee school-ma'ams, who taught us by precept to make our verbs agree with
                        their nominatives, and, per contra, by unconscious example to say "doo,"
                        "noo," and the like, for "dew," "new," etc.</p>
                    <p>The prevalence of the dialect among the uneducated classes was indeed, though
                        indirectly, a ministry to the cause of good English. The educated few,
                        fearing contamination of their children's speech through daily contact with
                        the ignorant, were more than usually strict in exacting correct usage at the
                        hands of their youngsters. I very well remember how grievously it afflicted
                        my own young soul that I was forbidden, under penalty, to say "chimbly" and
                        "flanner" for "chimney" and "flannel," to call inferior things "ornery," to
                        use the compromise term "'low"abbreviation of "allow,"which very generally
                        took the place of the Yankee "guess" and the Southern "reckon," and above
                        all to call tomatoes "tomatices."</p>
                    <p>It is of interest to recall the fact that this influential class of educated
                        men and women, included some really scholarly persons, as well as a good
                        many others who, without being scholarly, were educated and accustomed to
                        read. Among the scholarly ones, within the purview of my memory, were such
                        as Judge Algernon S. Stevens, Judge Algernon S. Sullivan, Judge Miles Cary
                        Eggleston, the Hendrickses, the Stapps, the Rev. Hiram Wason, my own <pb
                            id="VAA2427-018" n="9"/> father, and Mrs. Julia L. Dumont, a very
                        brilliant woman, who taught school for love of it and wrote books that in
                        our time would have given her something more than the provincial reputation
                        she shared with Alice and Phoebe Carey, and some others.</p>

                        upon their time and country was concerned, were the better class of
                        Kentuckians who had crossed the Ohio to become sharers in the future of the
                        great Northwest.</p>
                    <p>These were mostly men of extraordinary energyphysical and mentalwho had
                        mastered what the Kentucky schoolmasters could teach them, and had made of
                        their schooling the foundation of a broader education the dominant
                        characteristic of which was an enlightenment of mind quite independent of
                        scholarly acquisition.</p>
                    <p>These men were thinkers accustomed, by habit and inheritance, to look facts
                        straight in the face, to form their own opinions untrammeled by tradition,
                        unbiased by finespun equivocation, and wholly unrestrained in their search
                        for truth by conventional hobbles of any kind. Most of them had more or less
                        Scotch-Irish blood in their veins, and were consequently wholesome
                        optimists, full of courage, disposed to righteousness of life for its own
                        sake, and resolutely bent upon the betterment of life by means of their own
                        living.</p>
                    <p>Most of them numbered one or more Baptist or Methodist preachers among their
                        ancestrymen of healthy minds and open ones, men to whom religion was far
                        less a matter of emotion than of conduct, men who did the duty that lay next
                        to thembe it plowing or praying, <pb id="VAA2427-019" n="10"/> preaching or
                        fighting Indians or Englishmenwith an equal mind.</p>
                    <p>Men of such descent were educated by environment in better ways than any that
                        schools can furnish. From infancy they had lived in an atmosphere of
                        backwoods culture,culture drawn in part from such books as were accessible
                        to them, and in greater part from association with the strong men who had
                        migrated in early days to conquer the West and make of it a princely
                        possession of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>The books they had were few, but they were the very best that English
                        literature afforded, and they read them over and over again with diligence
                        and intelligence until they had made their own every fecundative thought the
                        books suggested. Then they went away, and thought for themselves, with
                        untrammeled freedom, of the things thus presented to their minds. I have
                        sometimes wondered if their method of education, chiefly by independent
                        thinking, and with comparatively little reverence for mere "authority,"
                        might not have been better, in its character-building results at least, than
                        our modern, more bookish process.</p>
                    <p>That question does not concern us now. What I wish to point out is the fact
                        that the country owes much to the influence of these strong men of affairs
                        and action, whose conviction that every man owes it to his fellowmen so to
                        live that this may be a better world for other men to live in because of his
                        having lived in it, gave that impulse to education which later made Indiana
                        a marvel and a model to the other states in all that concerns education.
                        Those men believed themselves and their children entitled to the best in
                        schooling as in everything else, and from the very beginning they set out to
                        secure it.</p>
                    <p>If a wandering schoolmaster came within call, they gave him a schoolhouse and
                        a place to live in, and bade <pb id="VAA2427-020" n="11"/> him "keep
                        school." When he had canvassed the region round about for "scholars," and
                        was readywith his ox gadsto open his educational institution, the three or
                        four of these men whose influence pervaded and dominated the region round
                        about, said a word or two to each other, and made themselves responsible for
                        the tuition fees of all the boys and girls in the neighborhood whose parents
                        were too poor to pay.</p>
                    <p>In the same spirit, years later, when an effort was made to establish
                        colleges in the state, these men or their children who had inherited their
                        impulse, were prompt to furnish the money needed, however hard pressed they
                        might be for money themselves. I remember that my motherthe daughter of one
                        of the most conspicuous of the Kentuckianswhen she was a young widow with
                        four children to bring up on an income of about $250 a year, subscribed $100
                        to the foundation of Indiana Asbury University, becoming, in return, the
                        possessor of a perpetual scholarship, entitling her for all time to maintain
                        a student there free of tuition. It was with money drawn from such sources
                        that the colleges of Indiana were founded.</p>
                    <p>Under the influence of these Kentuckians, Virginians, and men of character
                        who in smaller numbers had come out from New England and the Middle States,
                        there was from the first an impulse of betterment in the very atmosphere of
                        the West. Even the "poor whites" of the South who had migrated to the
                        Northwest in pursuit of their traditional dream of finding a land where one
                        might catch "two 'possums up one 'simmon tree," were distinctly uplifted by
                        the influence of such men, not as a class, perhaps, but in a sufficient
                        number of individual cases to raise the average level of their being. The
                        greater number of these poor whites continued to be the good-natured,
                        indolent, unthrifty people that their ancestors <pb id="VAA2427-021" n="12"
                        /> had always been. They remained content to be renters in a region where
                        the acquisition of land in independent ownership was easy. They continued to
                        content themselves with an inadequate cultivation of their crops, and a
                        meager living, consequent upon their neglect. They continued to give to
                        shooting, fishing, and rude social indulgences the time they ought to have
                        given to work. But their children were learning to read and write, and,
                        better still, were learning by observation the advantages of a more
                        industrious living, and when the golden age of steamboating came, they
                        sought and found profitable employment either upon the river or about the
                        wharves. The majority of these were content to remain laborers, as deckhands
                        and the like, but in some of them at least ambition was born, and they
                        became steamboat mates, pilots, and, in some cases, the captains and even
                        the owners of steamboats. On the whole, I think the proportion of the class
                        of people who thus achieved a higher status, bettering themselves in
                        enduring ways was quite as large as it ever is in the history of an
                        unfortunate or inferior class of men. In the generations that have followed
                        some at least of the descendants of that "poor white" class, whose case had
                        always been accounted hopeless, have risen to distinction in intellectual
                        ways. One distinguished judge of our time, a man now of national reputation,
                        is the grandson of a poor white who negligently cultivated land rented from
                        a relative of my own. His father was my schoolmate for a season, and was
                        accounted inferior by those of us who were more fortunately descended. So
                        much for free institutions in a land of hope, opportunity, and liberty,
                        where the "pursuit of happiness" and betterment was accounted an
                        "un-alienable right."</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> another case that comes home to me for reasons, the
                        betterment was more immediate. My maternal grandfather, the old Kentuckian,
                        George Craig, whose name is preserved in many ways in the geographical
                        nomenclature of Southern Indiana, had an abundantly large family of
                        children. But with generously helpful intent it was his habit to adopt
                        bright boys and girls whose parents were poverty-stricken, in order to give
                        them such education as was available in that time and country, or, in his
                        favorite phrase, to "give them a show in the world." One of these adopted
                        boys was the child of parents incredibly poor. When he came to my
                        grandfather the boy had never seen a tablecloth or slept in a bed. He knew
                        nothing of the uses of a knife and fork. A glass tumbler was to him a wonder
                        thing. He could neither read nor write, though he was eleven years of age.
                        The towel given to him for use on his first introduction to the family was
                        an inscrutable mystery until one of the negro servants explained its uses to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Less than a score of years later that boy was a lawyer of distinction, a man
                        of wide influence, a state senator of unusual standing, and chairman of the
                        committee that investigated and exposed the frauds perpetrated upon the
                        state in the building of the Madison and Indianapolis railroadthe first
                        highway of its kind constructed within the state. In one sense, he owed all
                        this to George Craig. In a truer sense he owed it to his own native ability,
                        which George Craig was shrewd enough to discover in the uncouth and ignorant
                        boy, and wise enough to give its opportunity.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was a common practice of the thrifty and well-to-do of
                        that time, thus to adopt the children of their poorer neighbors and bring
                        them up as members of their own families. Still more common was the practice
                        of taking destitute orphans as "bound boys" or "bound girls." These were
                        legally bound to service, instead of being sent to the poorhouse, but in
                        practical effect they became members of the families to whose heads they
                        were "bound," and shared in all respects the privileges, the schooling, and
                        everything else that the children of the family enjoyed. They were expected
                        to work, when there was work to be done, but so was every other member of
                        the family, and there was never the least suggestion of servile obligation
                        involved or implied. I remember well the affection in which my mother's
                        "bound girls" held her and us children, and the way in which, when they came
                        to be married, their weddings were provided for precisely as if they had
                        been veritable daughters of the house.</p>
                    <p>On one of those occasion it was rumored in the village, that a " shiveree
                        "Hoosier for charivariwas to mark the event. My father, whose Virginian
                        reverence for womanhood and marriage and personal dignity, was prompt to
                        resent that sort of insult, went to a neighbor and borrowed two shotguns. As
                        he carried them homeward through the main street of the village, on the
                        morning before the wedding, he encountered the ruffian who had planned the "
                        shiveree," and was arranging to carry it out. The man asked him, in
                        surprise, for my father was a studious recluse in his habits, if he were
                        going out after game.</p>
                    <p>"No," my father replied. "It is only that a very <pb id="VAA2427-024" n="15"
                        /> worthy young woman, a member of my family, is to be married at my house
                        to-night. I hear that certain 'lewd fellows of the baser sort' are planning
                        to insult her and me and my family with what they call a 'shiveree.' If they
                        do anything of the kind, <hi rend="i">I am going to fire four charges of
                            buckshot into the crowd.</hi>"</p>
                    <p>As my father was known to be a man who inflexibly kept his word, there was no
                        "shiveree" that night.</p>
                    <p>That father of mine was a man of the gentlest spirit imaginable, but at the
                        same time a man of resolute character, who scrupulously respected the rights
                        and the dignity of others, and insistently demanded a like respect for his
                        own. Quite episodically, but in illustration of the manners of the time, I
                        may here intrude an incident, related to me many years afterwards by Judge
                        Taylor, a venerable jurist of Madison. My father was looking about him for a
                        place in which to settle himself in the practice of law. He was temporarily
                        staying in Madison when a client came to him. The man had been inveigled
                        into a game of cards with some sharpers, and they had worked off some
                        counterfeit money upon him. He purposed to sue them. My father explained
                        that the law did not recognize the obligation of gambling debts, and the man
                        replied that he knew that very well, but that he wanted to expose the
                        rascals, and was willing to spend money to that end. The case came before
                        Judge Taylor. My father made an eloquently bitter speech in exposition of
                        the meanness of men whothe reader can imagine the rest. It was to make that
                        speech that the client had employed the young lawyer, and, in Judge Taylor's
                        opinion he "got his money's worth of gall and vitriol." But while the speech
                        was in progress, the three rascals became excited and blustering under the
                        castigation, and he, the judge, overheard talk of "shooting the fellow"to
                        wit my father. Just as the judge was meditating <pb id="VAA2427-025" n="16"
                        /> measures of restraint that might be effective at a time when most men
                        were walking arsenals, he heard one of them hurriedly warn his fellows in
                        this wise:</p>
                    <p>"Sayyou'd better not talk too much about shootingthey tell me that young
                        lawyer comes from Virginia, and he <hi rend="i">may be of shooting
                            stock</hi>."</p>
                    <p>The Virginians had a reputation for quickness on trigger in that region. The
                        warning was sufficient. The three gamblers took their punishment and slunk
                        away, and there was no assassination.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> readiness with which the well-to-do men of that region
                        adopted or otherwise made themselves responsible for the bringing up of
                        destitute children, was largely due to the conditions of life that prevailed
                        in that time and country. There was no considerable expense involved in such
                        adoption. The thrifty farmer, with more land than he could possibly
                        cultivate, produced, easily, all the food that even a multitudinous family
                        could consume. He produced also the wool, the flax, and the cotton necessary
                        for clothing, and these were carded, spun, woven, and converted into
                        garments for both sexes by the women folk of the home. Little, if anything,
                        was bought with actual money, and in the midst of such abundance an extra
                        mouth to feed and an extra back to clothe counted for next to nothing, while
                        at that time, when work, on everybody's part, was regarded quite as a matter
                        of course, the boy or girl taken into a family was easily able to "earn his
                        keep," as the phrase was.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, there was a great-hearted generosity inspiring it alla broadly
                        democratic conviction that everybody should have a chance in life, and that
                        he who had <pb id="VAA2427-026" n="17"/> should share with his brother who
                        had not, freely and without thought of conferring favor.</p>
                    <p>It was upon that principle, also, that the hospitality of that time rested.
                        There was always an abundance to eat, and there was always a bed to spare
                        for the stranger within the gates; or if the beds fell short, it was always
                        easy to spread a pallet before the fire, or, in extreme circumstances, to
                        make the stranger comfortable among a lot of quilts in a corn-house or
                        hay-mow.</p>
                    <p>It was my grandfather's rule and that of other men like him, to provide work
                        of some sort for every one who asked for it. An extra hoe in summer was
                        always of use, while in winter there was corn to be shelled, there were
                        apples to be "sorted," tools to be ground, ditches to be dug, stone fences
                        to be built, wood to be chopped, and a score of other things to be done,
                        that might employ an extra "hand" profitably. Only once in all his life did
                        George Craig refuse employment to a man asking for it. On that occasion he
                        gave supper, lodging, and breakfast to the wayfarer; but during the evening
                        the man complained that he had been walking all day with a grain of corn in
                        his shoe, and, as he sat before the fire, he removed it, to his great relief
                        but also to his undoing as an applicant for permanent employment. For the
                        energetic old Kentuckian could conceive of no ground of patience with a man
                        who would walk all day in pain rather than take the small trouble of sitting
                        down by the roadside and removing the offending grain of corn from his
                        shoe.</p>
                    <p>"I have no use," he said, "for a man as lazy as that."</p>
                    <p>Then his consciencce came to the rescue.</p>
                    <p>"I can't hire a lazy fellow like you for wages," he said; "but I have a ditch
                        to be dug. There will be fifteen hundred running feet of it, and if you
                        choose, I'll let you work at it, at so much a foot. Then if you <pb
                            id="VAA2427-027" n="18"/> work you'll make wages, while if you don't
                        there'll be nothing for me to lose on you but your keep, and I'll give you
                        that."</p>
                    <p>The man decided to move on.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> life of that early time differed in every way from
                        American life as men of the present day know it.</p>
                    <p>The isolation in which every community existed, compelled a degree of local
                        self-dependence the like of which the modern world knows nothing of. The
                        farmers did most things for themselves, and what they could not conveniently
                        do for themselves, was done for them in the villages by independent
                        craftsmen, each cunningly skilled in his trade and dependent upon factories
                        for nothing. In my native village, Vevay, which was in nowise different from
                        other Western villages upon which the region round about depended for
                        supplies, practically everything wanted was made. There were two tinsmiths,
                        who, with an assistant or two each, in the persons of boys learning the
                        trade, made every utensil of tin, sheet-iron, or copper that was needed for
                        twenty-odd miles around. There were two saddlers and harnessmakers; two or
                        three plasterers; several brick masons; several carpenters, who knew their
                        trade as no carpenter does in our time when the planing mill furnishes
                        everything already shaped to his hand, so that the carpenter need know
                        nothing but how to drive nails or screws. There was a boot and shoemaker who
                        made all the shoes worn by men, women, and children in all that country, out
                        of leather bought of the local tanner, to whom all hides were sold by their
                        producers. There was a hatter who did all his own work, whose vats yielded
                        all the headgear needed, from the <pb id="VAA2427-028" n="19"/> finest to
                        the commonest, and whose materials were the furs of animals caught or killed
                        by the farmers' boys and brought to town for sale. There was even a
                        wireworker, who provided sieves, strainers, and screenings of every kind,
                        and there was a rope walk where the cordage wanted was made.</p>
                    <p>In most households the women folk fashioned all the clothes worn by persons
                        of either sex, but to meet the demand for "Sunday bests" and that of
                        preachers who must wear broadcloth every day in the week, and of extravagant
                        young men who wished to dazzle all eyes with "store clothes," there was a
                        tailor who year after year fashioned garments upon models learned in his
                        youth and never departed from. No such thing as ready-made clothing or boots
                        or shoesexcept women's slipperswas known at the time of which I now write.
                        Even socks and stockings were never sold in the shops, except upon wedding
                        and other infrequent occasions. For ordinary wear they were knitted at home
                        of home-spun yarn. The statement made above is scarcely accurate. Both socks
                        and stockings were occasionally sold in the country stores, but they were
                        almost exclusively the surplus products of the industry of women on the
                        farms round about. So were the saddle blankets, and most of the bed blankets
                        used.</p>
                    <p>Local self-dependence was well-nigh perfect. The town depended on the country
                        and the country on the town, for nearly everything that was eaten or woven
                        or otherwise consumed. The day of dependence upon factories had not yet
                        dawned. The man who knew how to fashion any article of human use, made his
                        living by doing the work he knew how to do, and was an independent,
                        self-respecting man, usually owning his comfortable home, and destined by
                        middle age to possess a satisfactory competence.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-029" n="20"/>
                    <p>Whether all that was economically or socially better than the system which
                        has converted the independent, home-owning worker into a factory hand,
                        living in a tenement and carrying a dinner pail, while tariff tribute from
                        the consumer makes his employer at once a millionaire and the more or less
                        despotic master of a multitude of menis a question too large and too serious
                        to be discussed in a book of random recollections such as this. But every
                        "strike" raises that question in the minds of men who remember the more
                        primitive conditions as lovingly as I do.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of curious historical interest, too, it is worth while to recall
                        the fact that Henry Claybefore his desire to win the votes of the Kentucky
                        hemp-growers led him to become the leading advocate of tariff protectionused
                        to make eloquent speeches in behalf of free trade, in which he drew
                        horrifying pictures of life conditions in the English manufacturing centers,
                        and invoked the mercy of heaven to spare this country from like conditions
                        in which economic considerations should ride down social ones, trample the
                        life out of personal independence, and convert the home-owning American
                        workman into a mere "hand" employed by a company of capitalists for their
                        own enrichment at cost of his manhood except in so far as the fiat of a
                        trades union might interpose to save him from slavery to the employing
                        class.</p>
                    <p>Those were interesting speeches of Henry Clay's, made before he sacrificed
                        his convictions and his manhood to his vain desire to become President.</p>

                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> the time of my earliest recollections there was not a
                        mile of railroad in Indiana or anywhere else west of Ohio, while even in
                        Ohio there were only the crudest <pb id="VAA2427-030" n="21"/> beginnings of
                        track construction, on isolated lines that began nowhere and led no whither,
                        connecting with nothing, and usually failing to make even that
                        connection.</p>
                    <p>He who would journey from the East to the West, soon came to the end of the
                        rails, and after that he must toilsomely make his way by stagecoach across
                        the mountains, walking for the most part in mud half-leg deep, and carrying
                        a fence rail on his shoulder with which to help the stalled stagecoach out
                        of frequent mires.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, we heard much of the railroad and its wonders. It was our
                        mystery story, our marvel, our current Arabian Nights' Entertainment. We
                        were told, and devoutly believed, that the "railcars" ran at the rate of "a
                        mile a minute." How or why the liars of that early period, when lying must
                        have been in its infancy as an art, happened to hit upon sixty miles an hour
                        as the uniform speed of railroad trains, I am puzzled to imagine. But so it
                        was. There was probably not in all the world at that time a single mile of
                        railroad track over which a train could have been run at such a speed. As
                        for the railroads in the Western part of this country, they were chiefly
                        primitive constructions, with tracks consisting of strap ironwagon tires in
                        effectloosely spiked down to timber string pieces, over which it would have
                        been reckless to the verge of insanity to run a train at more than twelve
                        miles an hour under the most favorable circumstances. But we were told, over
                        and over again, till we devoutly believed itas human creatures always
                        believe what they have been ceaselessly told without contradictionthat the
                        "railcars" always ran at the rate of a mile a minute.</p>
                    <p>The first railroad in Indiana was opened in 1847. A year or two later, my
                        brother Edward and I, made our first journey over it, from Madison to
                        Dupont, a distance of thirteen miles. Edward was at that time a victim <pb
                            id="VAA2427-031" n="22"/> of the faith habit; I was beginning to
                        manifest a skeptical, inquiring tendency of mind which distressed those
                        responsible for me. When Edward reminded me that we were to enjoy our first
                        experience of traveling at the rate of a mile a minute, I borrowed his
                        bull's-eye watch and set myself to test the thing by timing it. When we
                        reached Dupont, after the lapse of ninety-six minutes, in a journey of
                        thirteen miles, I frankly declared my unbelief in the "mile a minute"
                        tradition. There was no great harm in that, perhaps, but the skeptical
                        spirit of inquiry that had prompted me to subject the matter to a time test,
                        very seriously troubled my elders, who feared that I was destined to become
                        a "free thinker," as my father had been before me, though I was not
                        permitted to know that. I was alarmed about my skeptical tendencies myself,
                        because I believed the theology and demonology taught me at church, having
                        no means of subjecting them to scientific tests of any kind. I no longer
                        believed in the "mile a minute" tradition, as everybody around me continued
                        to do, but I still believed in the existence and malign activity of a
                        personal devil, and I accepted the assurance given me that he was always at
                        my side whispering doubts into my ears by way of securing the damnation of
                        my soul under the doctrine of salvation by faith. The tortures I suffered on
                        this account were well-nigh incredible, for in spite of all I might do or
                        say or think, the doubts continued to arise in my mind, until at last I
                        awoke to the fact that I was beginning to doubt the doctrine of salvation by
                        faith itself, as a thing stultifying to the mind, unreasonable in itself,
                        and utterly unjust in its application to persons like myself, who found it
                        impossible to believe things which they had every reason to believe were not
                        true.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately I was young and perfectly healthy, and so, after a deal of
                        psychological suffering I found peace by <pb id="VAA2427-032" n="23"/>
                        reconciling myself to the conviction that I was foreordained to be damned in
                        any case, and that there was no use in making myself unhappy about it. In
                        support of that comforting assurance I secretly decided to accept the
                        Presbyterian doctrine of predestination instead of the Methodist theory of
                        free will in which I had been bred. I had to make this change of doctrinal
                        allegiance secretly, because its open avowal would have involved a sound
                        threshing behind the smoke-house, with perhaps a season of fasting and
                        prayer, designed to make the castigation "take."</p>
                    <p>I remember that when I had finally made up my mind that the doctrine of
                        predestination was true, and that I was clearly one of those who were
                        foreordained to be damned for incapacity to believe the incredible, I became
                        for a time thoroughly comfortable in my mind, very much as I suppose a man
                        of business is when he receives his discharge in bankruptcy. I felt myself
                        emancipated from many restraints that had sat heavily on my boyish soul.
                        Having decided, with the mature wisdom of ten or a dozen years of age, that
                        I was to be damned in any case, I saw no reason why I should not read the
                        fascinating books that had been forbidden to me by the discipline of the
                        Methodist Church, to which I perforce belonged.</p>
                    <p>In that early day of strenuous theological requirement, the Methodist Church
                        disapproved of literature as such, and approved it only in so far as it was
                        made the instrument of a propaganda. Its discipline required that each
                        person upon being "received into full membership"the Methodist equivalent of
                        confirmationshould take a vow not "to read such books or sing such songs as
                        do not pertain to the glory of God." I quote the phrase from memory, but
                        accurately I think. That prohibitions as interpreted by clerical authority
                        at the time, had completely closed to me the treasures of the library my
                        scholarly father had collected, and to which, under his dying instructions,
                            <pb id="VAA2427-033" n="24"/> my mother had added many scores of volumes
                        of the finest English literature, purchased with the money for which his law
                        books had been sold after his death.</p>
                    <p>I had read a little here and there in those books, and had been fascinated
                        with the new world they opened to my vision, when, at the ripe age of ten or
                        twelve years, I was compelled by an ill-directed clerical authority to
                        submit myself to the process of being "received into full membership," under
                        the assumption that I had "reached the age of responsibility."</p>
                    <p>After that the books I so longed to read were forbidden to meespecially a set
                        entitled "The British Drama," in which appeared the works of Ben Jonson,
                        Marlowe, Massinger, Beaumont and Fletcher, and a long list of other
                        classics, filling five thick volumes. By no ingenuity of construction could
                        such books be regarded as homilies in disguise, and so they were Anathema.
                        So was Shakespeare, and so even was Thiers' "French Revolution," of which I
                        had devoured the first volume in delight, before the inhibition fell upon
                        me, blasting my blind but eager aspiration for culture and a larger
                        knowledge of the world and of human nature.</p>

                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">FTER</hi> I made up my mind to accept damnation as my
                        appointed portion, I felt myself entirely free to revel at will in the
                        reading that so appealed to my hungry mind; free, that is to say, so far as
                        my own conscience was concerned, but no freer than before so far as the
                        restraints of authority could determine the matter. I had no hesitation in
                        reading the books when I could do so without being caught at it, but to be
                        caught at it was to be punished for it and, worse still, it was to have the
                        books placed <pb id="VAA2427-034" n="25"/> beyond my reach, a thing I
                        dreaded far more than mere punishment. Punishment, indeed, seemed to me
                        nothing more than a small advance upon the damnation I must ultimately
                        suffer in any case. The thing to be avoided was discovery, because discovery
                        must lead to the confiscation of my books, the loss of that liberty which my
                        acceptance of damnation had given to me.</p>
                    <p>To that end I practised many deceits and resorted to many subterfuges. I read
                        late at night when I was supposed to be asleep. I smuggled books out into
                        the woods and hid them there under the friendly roots of trees, so that I
                        might go out and read them when I was supposed to be engaged in a search for
                        ginseng, or in a hunt for the vagrant cow, to whose unpunctuality in
                        returning to be milked I feel that I owe an appreciable part of such culture
                        as I have acquired.</p>
                    <p>The clerical hostility to literature endured long after the period of which I
                        have been writing, long after the railroad and other means of freer
                        intercourse had redeemed the West from its narrow provincialism. Even in my
                        high school days, when our part of the country had reached that stage of
                        civilization that hangs lace curtains at its windows, wears store clothes of
                        week days, and paints garden fences green instead of white, we who were
                        under Methodist dominance were rigidly forbidden to read fiction or anything
                        that resembled fiction, with certain exceptions. The grown folk of our creed
                        permitted themselves to read the inane novels of the Philadelphia tailor, T.
                        S. Arthur; the few young men who "went to college," were presumed to be
                        immune to the virus of the Greek and Latin fictions they must read
                        thereprobably because they never learned enough of Greek or Latin to read
                        them understandinglyand finally there were certain polemic novels that were
                        generally permitted.</p>
                    <p>Among these last the most conspicuous example I remember <pb id="VAA2427-035"
                            n="26"/> was a violently anti-Roman Catholic novel called "Danger in the
                        Dark," which had a vogue that the "bestsellers" of our later time might
                        envy. It was not only permitted to us to read thatit was regarded as our
                        religious duty in order that we might learn to hate the Catholics with
                        increased fervor.</p>
                    <p>The religious animosities of that period, with their relentless intolerance,
                        their unreason, their matchless malevolence, and their eagerness to believe
                        evil, ought to form an interesting and instructive chapter in some history
                        of civilization in America, whenever a scholar of adequate learning and the
                        gift of interpretation shall undertake that work. But that is a task for
                        some Buckle or Lecky. It does not belong to a volume of random reminiscences
                        such as this is.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HOUGH</hi> the railroads, when at last they came to us, failed
                        utterly in their promise of transportation at the rate of "a mile a minute,"
                        they did something else, presently, that was quite as remarkable and far
                        worthier in its way. They ran down and ran over, and crushed out of
                        existence a provincialism that had much of evil promise and very little of
                        present good in it. With their coming, and in some degree in advance of
                        their coming, a great wave of population poured into the West from all
                        quarters of the country. The newcomers brought with them their ideas, their
                        points of view, their convictions, their customs, and their standards of
                        living. Mingling together in the most intimate ways, socially and in
                        business pursuits, each lost something of his prejudices and provincialism,
                        and gained much by contact with men of other ways of thinking and living.
                        Attrition sharpened the <pb id="VAA2427-036" n="27"/> perceptions of all and
                        smoothed away angles of offense. A spirit of tolerance was awakened such as
                        had never been known in the Western country before, and as the West became
                        populous and prosperous, it became also more broadly and generously
                        American, more truly national in character, and more accurately
                        representative of all that is best in American thought and life than any
                        part of the country had ever been. It represented the whole country and all
                        its parts.</p>
                    <p>The New Englanders, the Virginians, the Pennsylvanians, the Carolinians, the
                        Kentuckians, who were thus brought together into composite communities with
                        now and then an Irish, a French, a Dutch, or a German family, a group of
                        Switzers, and a good many Scotchmen for neighbors and friends, learned much
                        and quickly each from all the others. Better still, each unlearned the
                        prejudices, the bigotries, and the narrownesses in which he had been bred,
                        and life in the great West took on a liberality of mind, a breadth of
                        tolerance and sympathy, a generous humanity such as had never been known in
                        any of the narrowly provincial regions that furnished the materials of this
                        composite population. It seems to me scarcely too much to say that real
                        Americanism, in the broad sense of the term, had its birth in that new
                        "winning of the West," which the railroads achieved about the middle of the
                        nineteenth century.</p>
                    <p>With the coming of easier and quicker communication, not only was the West
                        brought into closer relations with the East, but the West itself became
                        quickly more homogeneous. There was a constant shifting of population from
                        one place to another, much traveling about, and a free interchange of
                        thought among a people who were eagerly alert to adopt new ideas that seemed
                        in any way to be better than the old. As I recall the rapid changes of that
                        time it seems to me that the betterments came <pb id="VAA2427-037" n="28"/>
                        with a rapidity rarely if ever equaled in human history. A year or two at
                        that time was sufficient to work a revolution even in the most conservative
                        centers of activity. Changes of the most radical kind and involving the most
                        vital affairs, were made over-night, as it were, and with so little shock to
                        men's minds that they ceased, almost immediately, to be topics of
                        conversation. The old had scarcely passed away before it was forgotten, and
                        the new as quickly became the usual, the ordinary, the familiar order of
                        things.</p>

                    <head>XIII</head>
                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">DO</hi> not mean to suggest that the West, or indeed any
                        other part of the country, at once put aside all its crudities of custom and
                        adopted the ways of living that we are familiar with in this later time. All
                        that has been a thing of gradual accomplishment, far slower in its coming
                        than most people realize.</p>
                    <p>I remember that when Indianapolis became a great railroad center and a city
                        of enormous proportionspopulation from 15,000 to 20,000, according to the
                        creative capacity of the imagination making the estimatea wonderful hotel
                        was built there, and called the Bates House. Its splendors were the subject
                        of wondering comment throughout the West. It had washstands, with decorated
                        pottery on them, in all its more expensive rooms, so that a guest sojourning
                        there need not go down to the common washroom for his morning ablution, and
                        dry his hands and face on a jack-towel. There were combs and brushes in the
                        rooms, too, so that if one wanted to smooth his hair he was not obliged to
                        resort to the appliances of that sort that were hung by chains to the
                        washroom walls.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-038" n="29"/>
                    <p>Moreover, if a man going to the Bates House for a sojourn, chose to pay a
                        trifle extra he might have a room all to himself, without the prospect of
                        being waked up in the middle of the night to admit some stranger, assigned
                        by the hotel authorities to share his room and bed.</p>
                    <p>All these things were marvels of pretentious luxury, borrowed from the more "
                        advanced" hostelries of the Eastern cities, and as such they became topics
                        of admiring comment everywhere, as illustrations of the wonderful progress
                        of civilization that was taking place among us.</p>
                    <p>But all these subjects of wonderment shrank to nothingness by comparison,
                        when the proprietors of the Bates House printed on their breakfast bills of
                        fare, an announcement that thereafter each guest's breakfast would be cooked
                        after his order for it was given, together with an appeal for patience on
                        the part of the breakfastersa patience that the proprietors promised to
                        reward with hot and freshly prepared dishes.</p>
                    <p>This innovation was so radical that it excited discussion hotter even that
                        the Bates House breakfasts. Opinions differed as to the right of a hotel
                        keeper to make his guests wait for the cooking of their breakfasts. To some
                        minds the thing presented itself as an invasion of personal liberty and
                        therefore of the constitutional rights of the citizen. To others it seemed
                        an intolerable nuisance, while by those who were ambitious of reputation as
                        persons who had traveled and were familiar with good usage, it was held to
                        be a welcome advance in civilization. In approving it, they were able to
                        exploit themselves as persons who had not only traveled as far as the state
                        capital, but while there had paid the two dollars a day, which the Bates
                        House charged for entertainment, instead of going to less pretentious
                        taverns where the customary charge of a dollar or a dollar and a half a day
                        still prevailed, and where breakfast was put upon the table before <pb
                            id="VAA2427-039" n="30"/> the going invited guests to rush into the
                        dining room and madly scramble for what they could get of it.</p>
                    <p>In the same way I remember how we all wondered over the manifestation of
                        luxury made by the owners of a newly built steamboat of the Louisville and
                        Cincinnati Mail Line, when we heard that the several staterooms were
                        provided with wash-basins. That was in the fifties. Before that time, two
                        common washroomsone for men and the other for womenhad served all the
                        passengers on each steamboat, and, as those washrooms had set-bowls with
                        running water, they were regarded as marvels of sumptuousness in travel
                        facilities. It was partly because of such luxury, I suppose, that we called
                        the steamboats of that time "floating palaces." They seemed so then. They
                        would not impress us in that way now. Perhaps fifty years hence the great
                        ocean liners of the present, over whose perfection of equipment we are
                        accustomed to wonder, will seem equally unworthy. Such things are
                        comparative and the world moves fast.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> crudities here referred to, however, are not properly
                        to be reckoned as belonging exclusively to the West, or as specially
                        indicative of the provincialism of the West. At that time and for long
                        afterward, it was usual, even in good hotels throughout the country, to
                        assign two men, wholly unacquainted with each other, to occupy a room in
                        common. It was expected that the hotel would provide a comb and brush for
                        the use of guests in each room, as the practice of carrying one's own toilet
                        appliances of that kind had not yet become general. Hotel rooms with private
                        bathrooms adjoining, were wholly unknown before the Civil War, and the
                        practice of taking a daily bath was <pb id="VAA2427-040" n="31"/> very
                        uncommon indeed. A hotel guest asking for such a thing would have been
                        pointed out to bystanders as a curiosity of effete dandyism.
                        Parenthetically, I may say that as late as 1886 I engaged for my wife and
                        myself a room with private bath on the first floor of the Nadeau House, then
                        the best hotel in Los Angeles, California. The man at the desk explained
                        that the bathroom did not open directly into the room, but adjoined it and
                        was accessible from the dead end of the hallway without. We got on very well
                        with this arrangement until Saturday night came, when, as I estimated the
                        number, all the unmarried men of the city took turns in bathing in my
                        private bathroom. When I entered complaint at the desk next morning, the
                        clerk evidently regarded me as a monster of arrogant selfishness. He
                        explained that as I had free use of the bathroom every day and night of the
                        week, I ought not to feel aggrieved at its invasion by other cleanly
                        disposed persons on "the usual night for taking a bath."</p>
                    <p>The experience brought two facts to my attention: first, that in the opinion
                        of the great majority of my fellow American citizens one bath a week was
                        quite sufficient, and, second, that the fixed bathtub, with hot and cold
                        water running directly into it, is a thing of comparatively modern use. I
                        suppose that in the eighteen-fifties, and quite certainly in the first half
                        of that decade, there were no such appliances of luxurious living in any but
                        the very wealthiest houses, if even there. Persons who wanted an "all-over
                        bath," went to a barber shop for it, if they lived in a city, and, if they
                        lived elsewhere, went without it, or pressed a family washtub into friendly
                        service.</p>
                    <p>So, too, as late as 1870, in looking for a house in Brooklyn, I found it
                        difficult to get one of moderate rent cost, that had other water supply than
                        such as a hydrant in the back yard afforded.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">O</hi> return to the changes wrought in the West by the
                        construction of railroads and the influx of immigration from all parts of
                        the country. In nothing else was the improvement more rapid or more
                        pronounced than in education. Until the early fifties, and even well into
                        them, educational endeavors and educational methods were crude, unorganized,
                        wasteful of effort, and utterly uncertain of result. From the very beginning
                        the desire for education had been alert and eager in the West, and the
                        readiness to spend money and effort in that behalf had been unstinted. But
                        the means were lacking and system was lacking. More important still there
                        was lack of any well-considered or fairly uniform conception of what
                        education ought to aim at or achieve.</p>
                    <p>In the rural districts schools were sporadic and uncertain. When a "master"
                        was available "school kept," and its chief activity was to teach the
                        spelling of the English language. Incidentally it taught pupils to read and
                        the more advanced onesten per cent of all, perhaps, to write. As a matter of
                        higher education rudimentary arithmetic had a place in the curriculum. Now
                        and then a schoolmaster appeared who essayed other things in a desultory way
                        but without results of any consequence. In the villages and towns the
                        schools were usually better, but even there the lack of any well-ordered
                        system was a blight.</p>
                    <p>The schoolmasters were frequently changed, for one thing, each newcoming one
                        bringing his own notions to bear upon problems that he was not destined to
                        remain long enough to solve. Even in the more permanent schools, kept by
                        very young or superannuated preachers, or by Irish schoolmasters who
                        conducted them on the <pb id="VAA2427-042" n="33"/> "knock down and drag
                        out" system, there was no attempt to frame a scheme of education that should
                        aim at well conceived results. In every such school there were two or three
                        boys taking "the classical course," by which was meant that without the
                        least question or consideration of their fitness to do so, they had dropped
                        all ordinary school studies and were slowly plodding along in rudimentary
                        Latin, in obedience to some inherited belief on the part of their parents
                        that education consists in studying Latin, that there is a benediction in a
                        paradigm, and that fitness for life's struggle is most certainly achieved by
                        the reading of "Historia Sacra," "Cornelius Nepos," and the early chapters
                        of "Csar's Commentaries on the Gallic War."</p>
                    <p>Other pupils, under the impression that they were taking a "scientific
                        course," were drilled in Comstock's Physiology and Natural Philosophy, and
                        somebody's "Geography of the Heavens." The rest of the schoolplebeians
                        allcontented themselves with reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, and a
                        vain attempt to master the mysteries and mists of Kirkham's Grammar.</p>
                    <p>The railroads quickly changed all this. They brought into the West men and
                        women who knew who Horace Mann was, and whose conceptions of education in
                        its aims and methods were definite, well order, and aggressive.</p>
                    <p>These set to work to organize graded school systems in the larger towns, and
                        the thing was contagious, in a region where every little town was
                        confidently ambitious of presently becoming the most important city in the
                        state, and did not intend in the meantime to permit any other to outdo it in
                        the frills and furbelows of largeness.</p>
                    <p>With preparatory education thus organized and systematized, and with easy
                        communication daily becoming easier, the ambition of young men to attend
                        colleges and <pb id="VAA2427-043" n="34"/> universities was more and more
                        gratified, so that within a very few years the higher educationso far as it
                        is represented by college coursesbecame common throughout the country, while
                        for those who could not achieve that, or were not minded to do so, the
                        teaching of the schools was adapted, as it never had been before, to the
                        purpose of real, even if meager education.</p>
                    <p>Even in the remotest country districts a new impetus was given to education,
                        and the subjection of the schools there to the supervision of school boards
                        and professional superintendents worked wonders of reformation. For one
                        thing the school boards required those who wished to serve as teachers to
                        pass rigid examinations in test of their fitness, so that it was no longer
                        the privilege of any ignoramus who happened to be out of a job to "keep
                        school." In addition to this the school boards prescribed and regulated the
                        courses of study, the classification of pupils, and the choice of
                        text-books, even in country districts where graded schools were not to be
                        thought of, and this supervision gave a new and larger meaning to school
                        training in the country.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was my fortune to be the first certified teacher under
                        this system in a certain rural district where the old haphazard system had
                        before prevailed, and my experience there connects itself interestingly, I
                        think, with a bit of literary history. It was the instigation of my brother,
                        Edward Eggleston's, most widely popular story, "The Hoosier Schoolmaster,"
                        which in its turn was the instigation of all the fascinating literature that
                        has followed it with Hoosier life conditions for its theme.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-044" n="35"/>
                    <p>My school district lay not many miles from the little town in which my family
                        lived, and as I had a good pair of legs, well used to walking, I went home
                        every Friday night, returning on Monday morning after a four o'clock
                        breakfast. On these week-end visits it was my delight to tell of the queer
                        experiences of the week, and Edward's delight to listen to them while he
                        fought against the maladies that were then threatening his brave young life
                        with early extinction.</p>
                    <p>Years afterwards he and I were together engaged in an effort to resuscitate
                        the weekly illustrated newspaper <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi>, which
                        had calamitously failed to win a place for itself, under a number of highly
                        distinguished editors, whose abilities seemed to compass almost every thing
                        except the art of making a newspaper that people wanted and would pay for.
                        Of that effort I shall perhaps have more to say in a future chapter. It is
                        enough now to say that the periodical had a weekly stagnationit will not do
                        to call it a circulationof only five or six thousand copies, nearly half of
                        them gratuitous, and it had netted an aggregate loss of many thousands of
                        dollars to the several publishers who had successively made themselves its
                        sponsors. It was our taskEdward's and mineto make the thing "pay," and to
                        that end both of us were cudgeling our brains by day and by night to devise
                        means.</p>
                    <p>One evening a happy thought came to Edward and he hurriedly quitted whatever
                        he was doing to come to my house and submit it.</p>
                    <p>"I have a mind, Geordie," he said, "to write a three number story, called
                        'The Hoosier Schoolmaster,' and to found it upon your experience at Riker's
                        Ridge."</p>
                    <p>We talked the matter over. He wrote and published the first of the three
                        numbers, and its popularity was instant. The publishers pleaded with him,
                        and so did <pb id="VAA2427-045" n="36"/> I, to abandon the three number
                        limitation, and he yielded. Before the serial publication of the story
                        ended, the subscription list of <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> had been
                        many times multiplied and Edward Eggleston was famous.</p>
                    <p>He was far too original a man, and one possessed of an imagination too
                        fertilely creative to follow at all closely my experiences, which had first
                        suggested the story to him. He made one or two personages among my pupils
                        the models from which he drew certain of his characters, but beyond that the
                        experiences which suggested the story in no way entered into its
                        construction. Yet in view of the facts it seems to me worth while to relate
                        something of those suggestive experiences.</p>
                    <p>I was sixteen years old when I took the school. Circumstances had compelled
                        me for the time to quit college, where, despite my youthfulness, I was in my
                        second year. The Riker's Ridge district had just been brought under
                        supervision of the school authorities at Madison. A new schoolhouse had been
                        built and a teacher was wanted to inaugurate the new system. I applied for
                        the place, stood the examinations, secured my certificate, and was
                        appointed.</p>
                    <p>On my first appearance in the neighborhood, the elders there seemed
                        distinctly disappointed in the selection made. They knew the school history
                        of the district. They remembered that the last three masters had been
                        "licked" by stalwart and unruly boys, the last one so badly that he had
                        abandoned the school in the middle of the term. They strongly felt the need,
                        therefore, of a master of mature years, strong arms, and ponderous fists as
                        the person chosen to inaugurate the new system. When a beardless boy of
                        sixteen presented himself instead, they shook their heads in apprehension.
                        But the appointment had been made by higher authority, and they had no
                        choice but to accept it. Appreciating the nature of their fears, <pb
                            id="VAA2427-046" n="37"/> I told the grave and reverend seigniors that
                        my schoolboy experience had shown my arms to be stronger, my fists heavier,
                        and my nimbleness greater perhaps than they imagined, but that in the
                        conduct of the school I should depend far more upon the diplomatic
                        nimbleness of my wits than upon physical prowess, and that I thought I
                        should manage to get on.</p>
                    <p>There was silence for a time. Then one wise old patriarch said:</p>
                    <p>"Well, may be so. But there's Charley Grebe. You wouldn't make a mouthful for
                        him. Anyhow, we'll see, we'll see."</p>
                    <p>Charley Grebe was the youth who had thrashed the last master so
                        disastrously.</p>
                    <p>Thus encouraged, I went to my task.</p>
                    <p>The neighborhood was in no sense a bad one. There were none of the elements
                        in it that gave character to "Flat Creek" as depicted in "The Hoosier
                        Schoolmaster." The people were all quiet, orderly, entirely reputable folk,
                        most of them devotedly pious. They were mainly of "Pennsylvania Dutch"
                        extraction, stolid on the surface but singularly emotional within. But the
                        school traditions of the region were those of the old time, when the master
                        was regarded as the common enemy, who must be thwarted in every possible
                        way, resisted at every point where resistance was possible, and "thrashed"
                        by the biggest boy in school if the biggest boy could manage that.</p>
                    <p>There was really some justification for this attitude of the young Americans
                        in every such district. For under the old system, as I very well remember
                        it, the government of schools was brutal, cruel, inhuman in a degree that
                        might in many cases have excused if it did not justify a homicidal impulse
                        on the part of its victims. The boys of the early time would never have
                        grown into the stalwart <pb id="VAA2427-047" n="38"/> Americans who fought
                        the Civil War if they had submitted to such injustice and so cruel a tyranny
                        without making the utmost resistance they could.</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>XVII</head>
                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">BEGAN</hi> my work with a little friendly address to the
                        forty or fifty boys and girls who presented themselves as pupils. I
                        explained to them that my idea of a school was quite different from that
                        which had before that time prevailed in that region; that I was employed by
                        the authorities to teach them all I could, by way of fitting them for life,
                        and that I was anxious to do that in the case of every boy and girl present.
                        I expressed the hope that they in their turn were anxious to learn all I
                        could teach them, and that if any of them found their studies too difficult,
                        I would gladly give my time out of school hours to the task of discovering
                        the cause of the difficulty and remedying it. I explained that in my view
                        government in a school should have no object beyond that of giving every
                        pupil opportunity to learn all he could, and the teacher opportunity to
                        teach all he could. I frankly abolished the arbitrary rule that had before
                        made of whispering a grave moral offense, and substituted for it a request
                        that every pupil should be careful not to disturb the work of others in any
                        way, so that we might all make the most of our time and opportunity.</p>
                    <p>It was a new gospel, and in the main it fell upon deaf ears. A few of the
                        pupils were impressed by its reasonableness and disposed to meet the new
                        teacher half way. The opinion of the majority was expressed by one boy whom
                        I overheard at recess when he said to one of his fellows:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-048" n="39"/>
                    <p>"He's skeered o' Charley Grebe, an' he's a-tryin' to soft-sawder us."</p>
                    <p>The first day or two of school were given to the rather perplexing work of
                        classifying pupils whose previous instruction had been completely at
                        haphazard. During that process I minutely observed the one foe against whom
                        I had received more than one warningCharley Grebe. He was a young man of
                        nearly twenty-one, six feet, one or two inches high, broad-shouldered,
                        muscular, and with a jaw that suggested all the relentless determination
                        that one young man can hold.</p>
                    <p>When I questioned him with a view to his classification, he was polite enough
                        in his uninstructed way, but exceedingly reserved. On the whole he impressed
                        me as a young man of good natural ability, who had been discouraged by bad
                        and incapable instruction. After he had told me, rather grudgingly I
                        thought, what ground his studies had covered, he suddenly changed places
                        with me and became the questioner.</p>
                    <p>"Say," he broke out, interrupting some formal question of mine, "Say, do you
                        know anything in fact? Do you know Arithmetic an' Algebra an' Geometry and
                        can you really teach me? or are you just pretending, like the rest?</p>
                    <p>I thought I understood him and I guessed what his experience had been. I
                        assured him that there was nothing in Arithmetic that I could not teach him,
                        that I knew my Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry, and could help him to
                        learn them, if he really desired to do so. Then adopting something of his
                        own manner I asked:</p>
                    <p>"What is it you want me to do, Charley? Say what you have to say, like a man,
                        and don't go beating about the bush."</p>
                    <p>For reply, he said:</p>
                    <p>"I want to talk with you. It'll be a long talk. I <pb id="VAA2427-049" n="40"
                        /> want you to go home with me to-night. Father said I might invite you.
                        Will you come?"</p>
                    <p>There was eager earnestness in his questions, but there was also a note of
                        discouragement, if not quite of despair in his tone. I agreed at once to go
                        with him for the night, and, taking the hand he had not thought of offering,
                        I added:</p>
                    <p>"If there is any way in which I can help you, Charley, I'll do it
                        gladly."</p>
                    <p>Whether it was the unaccustomed courtesy, or the awakening of a new hope, or
                        something else, I know not, but the awkward, overgrown boy seemed at once to
                        assume the dignity of manhood, and while he had never been taught to say
                        "thank you" or to use any other conventionally polite form of speech, he
                        managed to make me understand by his manner that he appreciated my offer,
                        and a few minutes later, school having been dismissed, he and I set out for
                        his home.</p>
                    <p>There he explained his case to me. He wanted to become a shipwrighta trade
                        which, in that time of multitudinous steamboat building on the Western
                        rivers, was the most inviting occupation open to a young man of energy. He
                        had discovered that a man who wished to rise to anything like a mastery in
                        that trade must have a good working knowledge of Arithmetic, elementary
                        Algebra, Geometry, and at least the rudiments of Trigonometry. He had wanted
                        to learn these things and some of his previous schoolmasters had undertaken
                        to teach them, with no result except presently to reveal to him their own
                        ignorance. His father permitted him six months more of schooling. He had
                        "sized me up," he said, and he believed I could teach him what he wanted to
                        learn. But could he learn it within six months? That was what he wanted me
                        to tell him. I put him through a close examination in Arithmetic that
                        nightconsuming <pb id="VAA2427-050" n="41"/> most of the nightand before
                        morning I had satisfied myself that he was an apt pupil who, with diligence
                        and such earnest determination as he manifested, could learn what he really
                        needed of mathematics within the time named.</p>
                    <p>"You can do it, Charley, if you work hard, and I'll help you, in school hours
                        and out," was my final verdict.</p>
                    <p>"It's a bargain," he said, and that was all he said. But a day or two later a
                        boy in schoola great, hulking fellow whose ugliness of disposition I had
                        early discernedmade a nerve-racking noise by dragging his pencil over his
                        slate in a way that disturbed the whole school. I bade him cease, but he
                        presently repeated the offense. Again I rebuked him, but five minutes or so
                        later he defiantly did the thing again, "just to see if the master dared,"
                        he afterward explained. Thereupon Charley Grebe arose, seized the fellow by
                        the ear, twisted that member until its owner howled with pain, and then,
                        hurling him back into his seat, said:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">"You heard the master! You'll mind him after this or I'll make
                            you</hi>."</p>
                    <p>The event fairly appalled the school. The thought that Charley Grebe was on
                        the master's side, and actively helping him to maintain discipline, seemed
                        beyond belief. But events soon confirmed it. There was a little fellow in
                        the school whom everybody loved, and whose quaint, childish ways afterwards
                        suggested the character of "Shocky" in "The Hoosier Schoolmaster." There was
                        also a cowardly brute there whose delight it was to persecute the little
                        fellow on the playground in intolerable ways. I sought to stop the thing. To
                        that end I devised and inflicted every punishment I could think of, short of
                        flogging, but all to no purpose. At last I laid aside my convictions with my
                        patience, and gave the big bully such a flogging as must have impressed his
                        mind if he had anything of the kind about his person.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-051" n="42"/>
                    <p>That day, at the noon recess, the big bully set to work to beat the little
                        boy unmercifully in revenge for what I had done for his protection. I was
                        looking out through a Venetian blind, with intent to go to the rescue, when
                        suddenly Charley Grebe, who was playing town ball threw down the bat, seized
                        the fellow, threw him across his knees, pinioned his legs with one of his
                        own, and literally wore out a dozen or more thick blue ash shingles over
                        that part of his victim's body which was made for spanking.</p>
                    <p>When at last he released the blubbering object of his wrath he slapped his
                        jaws soundly and said:</p>
                    <p>"Don't you go a-whining to the master about this. If you do it'll be a good
                        deal wuss for you. I'm a-takin' this here job off the master's hands."</p>
                    <p>I gave no hint that I had seen or heard. But from that hour forth no boy in
                        the school ever gave me the smallest trouble by misbehavior. The school
                        perfectly understood that Charley Grebe was "a-takin' this here job off the
                        master's hands," and the knowledge was sufficient.</p>
                    <p>After that only the big girlsmost of them older than I wasgave me trouble. I
                        met it with the explanation that I could never think of punishing a young
                        woman, and that I must trust to their honor and courtesy, as girls who
                        expected presently to be ladies, for their behavior. The appeal was a trifle
                        slow in eliciting a response, but in the end it answered its purpose.</p>

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HILE</hi> I was enrolling and classifying the pupils, I
                        encountered a peculiarly puzzling case. There were five John Riddels in the
                        school, and I found that all of them <pb id="VAA2427-052" n="43"/> were sons
                        of the same man, whose name also was John Riddel. No one of them had a
                        middle name or any other sort of name by which he might be distinguished
                        from his brothers. On the playground they were severally known as "Big John
                        Riddel," "John Riddel," "Johnny Riddel," "Little John Riddel," and "Little
                        Johnny Riddel," while their father was everywhere known as "Old John
                        Riddel," though he was a man under fifty, I should say. He lived near, in a
                        stone house, with stone barns and out-houses, an ingeniously devised
                        milk-house, and a still more ingeniously constructed device for bringing
                        water from the spring under the hill into his dwelling.</p>
                    <p>In brief his thrift was altogether admirable, and the mechanical devices by
                        which he made the most of every opportunity, suggested a fertilely inventive
                        mind on the part of a man whose general demeanor was stolid to the verge of
                        stupidity. When I was taking supper at his house one night by special
                        invitation, I asked him why he hadnamed all his sons John. For reply he
                        said:</p>
                    <p>"John is a very good name," and that was all the explanation I ever got out
                        of him.</p>

                    <p>O<hi rend="sc">NE</hi> pupil I had at Riker's Ridge, was Johnny G. His people
                        had some money and Johnny had always dressed better than the rest of us
                        could afford to do, when several years before, he and I had been classmates
                        in the second or third grade of the Grammar School in Madison, Johnny had
                        never got out of that grade, and even when I was in my second year in
                        college, he gave no promise of ever making a scholastic step forward. But he
                        had relatives on Riker's Ridge, and when he heard that I was to be the
                        teacher there he promised his people that <pb id="VAA2427-053" n="44"/> he
                        would really make an effort if they would let him live with his relatives
                        there and become my pupil. It was so arranged, and Johnny came to me, with
                        all his dazzling waistcoats and trousers with the latest style of pockets,
                        and all the rest of the upholstery with which he delighted to decorate his
                        person.</p>
                    <p>I think he really did make an effort to master the rudimentary school
                        studies, and I conscientiously endeavored to help him, not only in school
                        but of evenings. For a time there seemed to be a reasonable promise of
                        success in lifting Johnny to that level of scholastic attainment which would
                        permit him to return to Madison and enter the High School. But presently all
                        this was brought to naught. Johnny was seized by a literary ambition that
                        completely absorbed what mind he had, and made his school studies seem to
                        him impertinent intrusions upon the attention of one absorbed in higher
                        things.</p>
                    <p>He told me all about it one afternoon as I walked homeward with him, intent
                        upon finding out why he had suddenly ceased to get his lessons.</p>
                    <p>"I'm going to write a song," he told me, "and it's going to make me famous.
                        I'm writing it now, and I tell you it's fine."</p>
                    <p>"Tell me about it, Johnny," I replied. "What is its theme? And how much of it
                        have you written?"</p>
                    <p>"I don't know what it's to be about," he answered, "if that's what you mean
                        by its theme. But it's going to be great, and I'm going to make the tune to
                        it myself."</p>
                    <p>"Very well," I replied encouragingly. "Would you mind reciting to me so much
                        of it as you've written? I'd like to hear it."</p>
                    <p>"Why, of course. I tell you it's going to be great, but I haven't got much of
                        it done yetonly one line, in fact."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-054" n="45"/>
                    <p>Observing a certain discouragement in his tone I responded:</p>
                    <p>"Oh, well, even one line is a good deal, if it's good. Many a poem's fortune
                        has been made by a single line. Tell me what it is."</p>
                    <p>"Well, the line runs: 'With a pitcher of buttermilk under her arm.' Don't you
                        see how it sort o' sings? 'With a pitcher of buttermilk under her arm'why,
                        it's great, I tell you. Confound the school books! What's the use of
                        drudging when a fellow has got it in him to write poetry like that? 'With a
                            <hi rend="i">pit</hi>-cher of but-termilk un-der her arm'don't it sing?
                        'With a <hi rend="i">pit</hi>-cher of but-termilk un-der her arm.' 'With a
                            <hi rend="i">pit</hi>-cher of <hi rend="i">but</hi>-termilkun-der her
                        arm.' Whoopee, but it's great!"</p>
                    <p>I lost sight of Johnny soon after that, and I have never heard what became of
                        that buttermilk pitcher, or the fascinating rhythm in which it presented
                        itself. But in later years I have come into contact with many literary
                        ambitions that were scarcely better based than this. Indeed, if I were
                        minded to be cynicalas I am notI might mention a few magazine poets whose
                        pitchers of buttermilk seem to mebut all that is foreign to the purpose of
                        this book.</p>
                    <p>Before quitting this chapter and the period and region to which it relates, I
                        wish to record that Charley Grebe mastered the mathematics he needed, and
                        entered hopefully upon his apprenticeship to a ship carpenter. I hope he
                        rose to the top in the trade, but I know nothing about it.</p>

                    <head>XX</head>
                    <p>N<hi rend="sc">OT</hi> many months after my school-teaching experience came
                        to an end, circumstances decreed that my life should be changed in the most
                        radical way possible in this country. <pb id="VAA2427-055" n="46"/> I
                        quitted the rapidly developing, cosmopolitan, kaleidoscopic West, and became
                        a dweller upon the old family plantation in Virginia, where my race had been
                        bred and nurtured ever since 1635 when the first man of my name to cross the
                        seas established himself there and possessed himself of lavishly abundant
                        acres which subsequent divisions among his descendants had converted into
                        two adjoining plantationsthe ancestral homes of all the Egglestons, so far,
                        at least, as I knew them or knew of them.</p>
                    <p>I suppose I was an imaginative youth at seventeen, and I had read enough of
                        poetry, romance, and still more romantic history, to develop that side of my
                        nature somewhat unduly. At any rate it was strongly dominant, and the
                        contrast between the seething, sordid, aggressive, and ceaselessly eager
                        life of the West, in which I had been bred and the picturesquely placid,
                        well-bred, self-possessed, and leisurely life into which the transfer
                        ushered me, impressed me as nothing else has ever done. It was like escaping
                        from the turmoil of battle to the green pastures, and still waters of the
                        Twenty-third Psalm. It was like passing from the clamor of a stock exchange
                        into the repose of a library.</p>
                    <p>I have written much about that restful, refined, picturesque old Virginia
                        life in essays and romances, but I must write something more of it in this
                        place at risk of offending that one of my critics who not long ago
                        discovered that I had created it all out of my own imagination for the
                        entertainment of New England readers. He was not born, I have reason to
                        believe, until long after that old life had passed into history, but his
                        conviction that it never existed, that it was <hi rend="i">a priori</hi>
                        impossible, was strong enough to bear down the testimony of any
                        eye-witness's recollection.</p>
                    <p>It has often been a matter of chastening wonder and instruction to me to
                        observe how much more critics and <pb id="VAA2427-056" n="47"/> historians
                        can learn from the intuitions of their "inner consciousness" than was ever
                        known to the unfortunates who have had only facts of personal observation
                        and familiar knowledge to guide them. It was only the other day that a
                        distinguished historian of the modern introspective, self-illuminating
                        school upset the traditions of many centuries by assuring us that the
                        romantic story of Antony and Cleopatra is a baseless myth; that there never
                        was any love affair between the Roman who has been supposed to have "madly
                        flung a world away" for worship of a woman, and the "Sorceress of the Nile
                        "the "star-eyed Egyptian" who has been accused of tempting him to his
                        destruction; that Cleopatra merely hired of Antony the services of certain
                        legions that she needed for her defense, and paid him for them in the
                        current money of the time and country.</p>
                    <p>Thus does the incredulous but infallible intuition of the present correct the
                        recorded memory of the past. I have no doubt that some day the country will
                        learn from that sort of superior consciousness that in the Virginia campaign
                        of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania and Cold Harbor, where men are now believed
                        to have fought and marched so heroically with empty bellies and often with
                        unshod feet, there were in fact no such discomforts incident to the
                        discussion; that Grant and Lee like the courteous commanders they were,
                        suspended the argument of arms at the dinner hour each day in order that
                        their men might don evening clothes and patent leather shoes and sit down to
                        banquets of eleven courses, with <hi rend="i">pousse cafs</hi> and cigars at
                        the end. Nevertheless, I shall write of the old Virginia life as I remember
                        it, and let the record stand at that untill such time as it shall be shown
                        by skilled historical criticism that the story of the Civil War is a sun
                        myth and that the old life which is pictured as having preceded it was the
                        invention of the romance writers.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> first thing that impressed me in that old life, when I
                        was thrust into it, was its repose, the absence of stress or strain or
                        anxious anticipation, the appreciation of to-morrow as the equal of to-day
                        for the doing of things and the getting of things done. My trunks had missed
                        connection somewhere on the journey, and I thought of telegraphing about the
                        matter. My uncle, the master of the plantation and head of the family,
                        discouraged that, and suggested that I should go fishing in a neighboring
                        creek instead. The telegraph office was six miles away. He had never sent a
                        telegram in his life. He had no doubt the trunks would come along to-morrow
                        or next day, and the fish in the creek were just then biting in encouraging
                        fashion.</p>
                    <p>That was my first lesson, and it impressed me strongly. Where I had come from
                        nobody would have thought of resting under the uncertainty or calmly
                        contemplating the unwarranted delay. Here nobody thought of doing anything
                        else, and as the trunks did in fact come the next day without any
                        telegraphing or hurry or worry, I learned that it was just as well to go
                        fishing as to go fussing.</p>
                    <p>The restful leisureliness of the life in Virginia was borne in upon me on
                        every hand. I suppose my nerves had really been upon a strain during all the
                        seventeen years that I had lived, and the relief I found in my new
                        surroundings doubtless had much to do with my appreciation of it all. I had
                        been used to see hurry in everything and everybody; here there was no such
                        thing as hurry. Nobody had a "business engagement" that need interfere with
                        anything else he was minded to do. "Business," indeed, was regarded as
                        something to be attended to on the next court day, when all men having
                        affairs to arrange <pb id="VAA2427-058" n="49"/> with each other were sure
                        to meet at the Court-Houseas the country seat village was usually called.
                        Till then it could wait. Nobody was going to move away. Everybody was "able
                        to owe his debts." Why bother, then, to make a journey for the settlement of
                        a matter of business which could wait as well as not for next court day to
                        come round? It was so much pleasanter to stay at home, to entertain one's
                        friends, to ride over the plantation, inspecting and directing crop work, to
                        take a gun and go after squirrels or birds or turkeys, to play back-gammon
                        or chess or dominoes in the porch, to read the new books that everybody was
                        talking about, or the old ones that Virginians loved morein brief, there was
                        no occasion for hurry, and the Virginians wasted none of their vital force
                        in that way.</p>
                    <p>The very houses suggested repose. They had sat still upon their foundations
                        for generations past, and would go on doing so for generations to come. The
                        lawns were the growth of long years, with no touch of recent gardeners'work
                        about them. The trees about the house grounds had been in undisputed
                        possession there long before the grandfathers of the present generation were
                        born. There was nowhere any suggestion of newness, or rawness, of change
                        actual or likely to come. There were no new peopleexcept the babiesand
                        nobody ever dreamed of changing his residence.</p>

                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">NOTHER</hi> thing that peculiarly impressed me, coming as I
                        did from a region where the mart was the center about which all life's
                        activities circled, was the utter absence of talk about money or the things
                        that relate to money. Practically there was no money in use among the <pb
                            id="VAA2427-059" n="50"/> planter folk, except when a journey to distant
                        points required the lining of a purse. Except in the very smallest way the
                        planters never used money in their daily lives. They rarely bought anything
                        directly, and they never thought of selling anything except in planter
                        fashion through accredited agencies. Once a year they shipped the tobacco
                        and the wheat their fields had produced, to the city, for a commission
                        merchant to sell. The commission merchant held a considerable part of the
                        proceeds to the planter's credit, and when the planter wanted anything of
                        consequence he simply wrote to the commission merchant to buy it for him.
                        The rest of the money from the sale of the plantation products was deposited
                        in bank to the planter's account. If the women folk went to town on a
                        shopping expedition, they bought whatever they wanted in the stores and had
                        it "charged," for every planter's credit was limitless in the shops. When
                        the bill was rendered, which was never in a hurry, the planter drew a check
                        in discharge of it. He had no "blank check" book. No such thing was known in
                        that community. He simply wrote his check at top of a sheet of foolscap,
                        stating in it what it was for, and courteously asking the bank "please" to
                        pay the amount. Then he carefully cut off the remainder of the sheet and put
                        it away as an economy of paper. The next time he drew a check or anything of
                        the sort, he took a fresh sheet of paper for the purpose and carefully laid
                        away all that was not used of it. Thus was his instinct of economy
                        gratified, while his lordly sense of liberality in the use of material
                        things was not offended. When he died, the drawers filled with large and
                        small fragments of foolscap sheets were cleared out and left for his
                        successor to fill in his turn.</p>
                    <p>This custom of paying by check so strongly commended itself to a certain
                        unworldly parson of my time, that he <pb id="VAA2427-060" n="51"/> resorted
                        to it on one occasion in entire ignorance and innocence of the necessity of
                        having a bank deposit as a preliminary to the drawing of checks. He went to
                        Richmond and bought a year's supplies for his little placeit was too small
                        to be called a plantationand for each purchase he drew a particularly polite
                        check. When the banks threw these out, on the ground that their author had
                        no account, the poor old parson found the situation a difficult one to
                        understand. He had thought that the very purpose of a bank's being was to
                        cash checks for persons who happened to be short of money.</p>
                    <p>"Why, if I'd had the money in the bank," he explained, "I shouldn't have
                        written the checks at all; I should have got the money and paid the
                        bills."</p>
                    <p>Fortunately the matter came to the knowledge of a well-to-do and generous
                        planter who knew parson J. and who happened to be in Richmond at the time.
                        His indorsement made the checks good, and saved the unworldly old person a
                        deal of trouble.</p>
                    <p>The planters were not all of them rich by any means. Hardly one of those in
                        Virginia had possessions that would to-day rank him even among moderately
                        rich men. But they were scrupulously honorable men, they were men of
                        reasonable property, and their credit rested firmly upon the fact that they
                        were able to pay and the equally important fact that they meant to pay. They
                        lived lavishly, but the plantation itself furnished most of the materials of
                        the lavishness, so that there was no extravagance in such living. For the
                        rest they had a sufficient regard for those who were to come after them to
                        keep the total volume of the debt upon the estate within such limits as the
                        estate could easily stand.</p>
                    <p>What I wish to emphasize here is that the methods of their monetary
                        transactions were such as to make of money <pb id="VAA2427-061" n="52"/> a
                        very infrequent subject of consideration in their lives and
                        conversations.</p>
                    <p>Economically it would have been better for them if things had been otherwise,
                        but socially, the utter absence of pecuniary flavor from their intercourse,
                        lent a peculiar charm to it, especially in the eyes and mind of a youth
                        brought up as I had been in an atmosphere positively grimy with the soot of
                        monetary considerations.</p>
                    <p>There was hardly one of those plantations whose utterly waste products were
                        not worth more in the markets near at hand than were the tobacco and wheat
                        which alone the planters sold. When I came into the practice of law a few
                        years later, and had charge of the affairs of a number of estates, I brought
                        this matter of waste to the attention of my clients, with all the
                        earnestness I could put into my pleading. I showed them prices current to
                        prove that if they chose to market their surplus apples, potatoes, sweet
                        potatoes, lambs, pigs, poultry, and dairy products, all of which they gave
                        away or suffered to go to waste, they might discharge their hereditary debts
                        at once and build up balances in bank. They had sagacity enough to
                        understand the facts, but not one of them would ever consent to apply them
                        practically. It would be "Yankee farming," was the ready reply, and that was
                        conclusive. It was not the custom of the planters to sell any but staple
                        products, and they were planters, not farmers.</p>
                    <p>All these things helped, when I first came into relations with them, to
                        impress my young mind with the poise, the picturesqueness, the restful
                        leisureliness of the Virginian life, and the utter absence from it of
                        strenuousness, and still more of sordidness. For the first time in my life I
                        was living with people who thought of money only on those annual or other
                        occasions when they were settling their affairs and paying their debts by
                        giving notes for <pb id="VAA2427-062" n="53"/> their sum; people who
                        regarded time not as something to be economized and diligently utilized for
                        the sake of its money value, but as a means of grace, if I may so speak
                        without irreverence; as an opportunity of enjoyment, for themselves and for
                        others; as a thing to be spent with the utmost lavishness in the doing of
                        things agreeable, in the reading of books that pleased, in the riding of
                        horses that put the rider upon his metal to match their tameless spirit, in
                        the cultivation of flowers, in the improvement of trees by grafting and
                        budding, and even in the idler pleasures of tossing grace hoops, or hotly
                        maintaining an indoor contest at battledore and shuttlecock when it rained
                        heavily. These and a score of other pastimes seemed good in the eyes of the
                        Virginian men and women. The men went shooting or fox hunting or hare
                        coursing, or fishing, each in its season. The women embroidered and knitted
                        nubias, and made fancy work, and they walked long miles when not riding with
                        escorts, and dug much in the ground in propagation ofthe flowers they loved.
                        They kept house, too, with a vigilance born of the fact that in keeping
                        house they were also keeping plantation. For they must not only supervise
                        the daily dispensation of foodstuffs to all the negroes, but they must visit
                        and personally care for the sick, the aged, the infirm, and the infantile
                        among the black people. They must put up fruits and jams and pickles and
                        ketchups and jellies and shrubs and cordials enough to stock a warehouse, in
                        anticipation of the plantation needs. They must personally cut out and
                        direct the making of all the clothing to be worn by the blacks on the
                        plantation, for the reason that the colored maids, seamstresses and
                        dressmakers who were proud to fashion the gowns of their young mistresses,
                        simply would not "work for de field hands,"meaning the negroes of the
                        plantation.</p>
                    <p>Yet with it all these women were never hurried, never <pb id="VAA2427-063"
                            n="54"/> scant of time in which to do anything that might give pleasure
                        to another. I never knew one of them to plead preoccupation as a reason for
                        not going riding or walking, or rendering some music, or joining in a game,
                        or doing anything else that others wanted her to do.</p>
                    <p>The reason for all this was simple enough. The young women who kept houseand
                        it was usually the young women who did sowere up and at it before the dawn.
                        By the time that the eight-thirty or nine o'clock breakfast was served, all
                        their necessary work was done for the day; often it was done in time to let
                        them take a ride before breakfast if the young man suggesting it happened to
                        be an agreeable fellow. After all was done upon which that day's conduct of
                        the house and the plantation depended, the gentlewomen concerned adopted the
                        views of their masculine mentors and exemplars. They accepted to-morrow as a
                        good enough stalking horse for to-day, and, having laid out their work well
                        in advance, they exacted of their servitors that the morrow's morning should
                        begin with a demonstration of to-day's work well done.</p>
                    <p>So they, too, had leisure, just as the meal hours had. I had been brought up
                        on five or six o'clock breakfasts, eleven-thirty or twelve o'clock dinners,
                        and early suppers. Here the breakfast hour was eight thirty at the earliest
                        and nine usually; " snack " was served about one to those who chose to come
                        to it, dinner at three or four, with no hurry about it, and supper came at
                        ninethe hour at which most people in the West habitually went to bed.</p>
                    <p>The thing suited me, personally, for I had great ambitions as a student and
                        habitually dug at my mathematics, Latin, and Greek until two in the morning.
                        I was always up by daylight, and after a plunge into the cold water provided
                        for me in a molasses barrel out under the <pb id="VAA2427-064" n="55"/>
                        eaves, I usually took a ride in company with the most agreeable young woman
                        who happened to be staying in the house at the time.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes I had two to escort, but that was rare. Usually there was another
                        young man in the house, and usually, under such circumstances, I saw to it
                        that he did not lie long abed. And even when there was no such recourse, the
                        " other girl " was apt to conjure up some excuse for not wishing to ride
                        that morning.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>XXIII</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">NDEED</hi>, one of the things that most deeply impressed me
                        among the Virginians was the delicacy and alert thoughtfulness of their
                        courtesy. The people of the West were not ill-mannered boors by any means,
                        but gentle, kindly folk. But they were not versed in those little momentary
                        courtesies of life which create a roseate atmosphere of active good will. In
                        all that pertained to courtesy in the larger and more formal affairs of
                        social life, the people of the West were even more scrupulously attentive to
                        the requirements of good social usage than these easy-going Virginians were,
                        with their well-defined social status and their habit of taking themselves
                        and each other for granted. But in the little things of life, in their
                        alertness to say the right word or do the trifling thing that might give
                        pleasure, and their still greater alertness to avoid the word or act that
                        might offend or incommode, the Virginians presented to my mind a new and
                        altogether pleasing example of courtesy.</p>
                    <p>In later years I have found something like this agreeably impressed upon me
                        when I go for a time from New York to Boston. Courtesy could not be finer or
                        more considerate among people of gentle breeding who know <pb
                            id="VAA2427-065" n="56"/> each other than it is in New York. But in
                        their considerate treatment of strangers, casually encountered in public
                        places, the Boston people give a finer, gentler, more delicate flavor to
                        their courtesy, and it is a delightful thing to encounter.</p>
                    <p>In Virginia this quality of courtesy was especially marked in the intercourse
                        of men and women with each other. The attitude of both was distinctly
                        chivalrous. To the womanbe she a child of two, a maiden of twenty, or a
                        gentlewoman so well advanced in years that her age was unmentionablethe man
                        assumed an attitude of gentle consideration, of deference due to sex, of
                        willingness to render any service at any cost, and of a gently protective
                        guardianship that stopped at nothing in the discharge of its duty. To the
                        man, be he old or young, the woman yielded that glad obedience that she
                        deemed due to her protector and champion.</p>
                    <p>I had never seen anything like this before. In the West I had gone to school
                        with all the young women I knew. I had competed with them upon brutally
                        equal terms, in examinations and in struggles for class honors, and the
                        like. They and we boys had been perfectly good friends and comrades, of
                        course, and we liked each other in that half-masculine way. But the
                        association was destructive of romance, of fineness, of delicate
                        attractiveness. There was no glamor left in the relations of young men and
                        young women, no sentiment except such as might exist among young men
                        themselves. The girls were only boys of another sort. Our attitude toward
                        them was comradely but not chivalric. It was impossible to feel the roseate
                        glow of romance in association with a young woman who had studied in the
                        same classes with one, who had stood as a challenge in the matter of
                        examination marks, and who met one at any hour of the day on equal terms,
                        with a cheery "good-morning" or "good-evening" <pb id="VAA2427-066" n="57"/>
                        that had no more of sentiment in it than the clatter of a cotton mill.</p>
                    <p>In my judgment, that is the conclusive objection to coeducation, except
                        perhaps among the youngest children. It robs the relations of the sexes of
                        sentiment, of softness, of delicacy. It makes of girls an inferior sort of
                        boys, and of boys an inferior sort of girls. It cannot completely negative
                        sex, but it can and does sufficiently negative it to rob life of one of its
                        tenderest charms.</p>
                    <p>In Virginia for the first time I encountered something different. There the
                        boys were sent to old field schools where in rough and tumble fashion, they
                        learned Latin and robust manliness, Greek and a certain graciousness of
                        demeanor toward others, the absence of which would have involved them in
                        numberless fights on the playgrounds. The girls were tenderly dame-nurtured
                        at home, with a gentlewoman for governess, with tutors to supplement the
                        instruction of the governess, and with a year or two, perhaps, for
                        finishing, at Le Febre's or Dr. Hoge's, or some other good school for young
                        women.</p>
                    <p>Both the young men and the young women read voluminouslythe young men in
                        part, perhaps, to equip themselves for conversational intercourse with the
                        young women. They both read polite literature, but they read history also
                        with a diligence that equipped them with independent convictions of their
                        own, with regard to such matters as the conduct of Charlotte Corday, the
                        characters of Mirabeau, Danton, and Robespierre, the ungentlemanly treatment
                        given by John Knox to Mary, Queen of Scots, and all that sort of thing.
                        Indeed, among the Virginia women, young and old, the romantic episodes of
                        history, ancient, medival, and modern, completely took the place, as
                        subjects of conversation, of those gossipy personalities that make up the
                        staple of conversation among women generally.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-067" n="58"/>
                    <p>Let me not be misunderstood. These women did not assume to be "learned
                        ladies." It was only that they knew their history and loved it and were fond
                        of talking about it, quite as some other women are fond of talking about the
                        interesting scandal in the domestic relations of the reigning matine
                        hero.</p>
                    <p>The intercourse between men and women thus educated was always easy,
                        gracious, and friendly, but it was always deferential, chivalric, and imbued
                        with that recognition of sex which, without loss of dignity on either side,
                        holds man to be the generously willing protector, and woman the proudly
                        loyal recipient of a protection to which her sex entitles her, and in return
                        for which she gladly yields a submission that has nothing of surrender in
                        it.</p>
                    <p>There was a fascination to me in all this, that I find it impossible to
                        describe and exceedingly difficult even to suggest.</p>
                    <p>I may add that I think the young women of that time in Virginia were
                        altogether the best educated young women I have ever encountered in any time
                        or country. And, best of all, they were thoroughly, uncompromisingly
                        feminine.</p>
                    <p>Of the men I need only say that they were masculine, and fit mates for such
                        women. I do not at all think they were personally superior to men of other
                        parts of the country in those things that pertain to character and conduct,
                        but at least they had the advantage of living in a community where public
                        opinion was all-dominant, and where that resistless force insisted upon
                        truth, integrity, and personal courage as qualities that every man must
                        possess if he expected to live in that community at all. It was <hi rend="i"
                            >noblesse oblige,</hi> and it inexorably controlled the conduct of all
                        men who hoped for recognition as gentlemen.</p>
                    <p>The sentiment took quixotic forms at times, perhaps, <pb id="VAA2427-068"
                            n="59"/> but no jesting over these manifestations can obscure the fact
                        that it compelled men to good behavior in every relation of life and made
                        life sweeter, wholesomer, and more fruitful of good than it otherwise would
                        have been.</p>
                    <p>I must add a word with respect to that most fascinating of all things, the
                        Virginia girl's voice. This was music of so entrancing a sort that I have
                        known young men from other parts of the country to fall in love with a voice
                        before they had seen its possessor and to remain in love with the owner of
                        it in spite of her distinct lack of beauty when revealed in person.</p>
                    <p>Those girls all dropped the "g"s at the end of their participles; they
                        habitually used double negatives, and, quite defiantly of dictionaries, used
                        Virginian locutions not sanctioned by authority. If challenged on the
                        subject their reply would have been that which John Esten Cooke gave to an
                        editor who wanted to strike a phrase out of one of his Virginia romances, on
                        the ground that it was not good English. "It's good Virginian," he answered,
                        "and for my purpose that is more important."</p>
                    <p>But all such defects of speechdue not to ignorance but to a charming
                        wilfulnesswere forgotten in the music of the voices that gave them
                        utterance.</p>
                    <p>There are no such voices now, even in Virginia, I regret to say. Not of their
                        own fault, but because of contact with strangely altered conditions, the
                        altogether charming Virginia girls I sometimes meet nowadays, have voices
                        and intonations not unlike those of women in other parts of the country,
                        except that they preserve enough of the old lack of emphasis upon the
                        stronger syllables to render their speech often difficult to understand.
                        There is compensation for that in the gentle, laughing readiness with which
                        they repeat utterances not understood on their first hearing.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was during the roseate years of the old Virginia life
                        not long before the war that I had my first and only serious experience of
                        what is variously and loosely called the "occult" and the
                        "supernatural."</p>
                    <p>It is only in answer to solicitation that I tell the story here as it has
                        been only in response to like solicitation that I have orally told it
                        before.</p>
                    <p>In order that I may not be misunderstood, in order that I may not be unjustly
                        suspected of a credulity that does not belong to me, I wish to say at the
                        outset that I am by nature and by lifelong habit of mind a skeptic. I
                        believe in the natural order, in cause and effect, in the material basis of
                        psychological phenomena. I have no patience with the mystical or the
                        mysterious. I do not believe in the miraculous, the supernatural, the
                        occultcall it what you will.</p>
                    <p>And yet the experience I am about to relate is literally true, and the story
                        of it a slavishly faithful record of facts. I make no attempt to reconcile
                        those facts with my beliefs or unbeliefs. I venture upon no effort at
                        explanation. I have set forth above my intellectual attitude toward all such
                        matters; I shall set forth the facts of this experience with equal candor.
                        If the reader finds the facts irreconcilable with my intellectual
                        convictions, I must leave him to judge as he may between the two, without
                        aid of mine. The facts are these:</p>
                    <p>I was one of a house party, staying at one of the most hospitable of Virginia
                        mansions. I was by courtesy of Virginia clannishness "cousin" to the
                        mistress of the house, and when no house party was in entertainment I was an
                        intimate there, accustomed to go and come at <pb id="VAA2427-070" n="61"/>
                        will and to reckon myself a member of the family by brevet.</p>
                    <p>At the time now considered, the house was unusually full, when a letter came
                        announcing the immediate coming of still other guests. In my close intimacy
                        with the mistress of the plantation I became aware of her perplexity. She
                        didn't know where and how to bestow the presently coming guests. I suggested
                        that I and some others should take ourselves away, a suggestion which her
                        hospitable soul rejected, the more particularly in my case, perhaps, because
                        I was actively planning certain entertainments in which she was deeply
                        interested. Suddenly it occurred to me that during my long intimacy in the
                        house I had never known anybody to occupy the room or rooms which
                        constituted the second story of the west wing of the building. I asked why
                        not bring that part of the spacious mansion into use in this emergency,
                        thinking that its idleness during all the period of my intimacy there had
                        been due only to the lack of need in a house so large.</p>
                    <p>"Cousin Mary," with a startled look of inquiry upon her face, glanced at her
                        husband, who sat with us alone on a piazza.</p>
                    <p>"You may as well tell him the facts," he said in reply to the look. "He won't
                        talk."</p>
                    <p>Then she told me the history of the room, explaining that she objected to any
                        talk about it because she dreaded the suspicion of superstition. Briefly the
                        story was that several generations earlier, an old man almost blind, had
                        died there; that during his last illness he had had his lawyer prepare his
                        will there; that he was too feeble, when the lawyer finished, even to sign
                        the document; that he placed it under his pillow; that during the night his
                        daughter abstracted and copied it, changing only one clause in such fashion
                        as to defeat the long cherished <pb id="VAA2427-071" n="62"/> purpose of the
                        dying man; that she placed her new draft under the pillow where the old one
                        had been and that in the morning the nearly blind old man executed that
                        instead of the other.</p>
                    <p>"Now I'm not superstitious, you know," said Cousin Mary very earnestly, " but
                        it is a fact that from that day to this there has been something the matter
                        with that room. During the time of my great uncle, who brought me up, you
                        know, and from whom I inherited the plantation, many persons tried to sleep
                        in it but none ever stayed there more than an hour or two. They always fled
                        in terror from the chamber, until at last my uncle forbade any further
                        attempt to occupy the room lest this should come to be called a haunted
                        house. Since I became mistress here three persons have tried the thing, all
                        of them with the same result."</p>
                    <p>"It's stuff and nonsense," I interposed, "but what yarns did they tell?"</p>
                    <p>"They one and all related the same singular experience," she answered,
                        "though neither of them knew what the experience of the others had
                        been."</p>
                    <p>"What was it?" I asked with resolute incredulity.</p>
                    <p>"Why, each of them went to the room in full confidence that nothing would
                        happen. Each went to bed and to sleep. After a while he waked to find the
                        whole room pervaded by a dim, yellowish gray or grayish yellow light. Some
                        of them used one combination of words and some the other, but all agreed
                        that the light had no apparent source, that it was all-pervasive, that it
                        was very dim at first, but that it steadily increased until they fied in
                        panic from its nameless terror. For ten years we permitted no repetition of
                        the experiment, but a year ago my brotherhe's an army officer, you
                        knowinsisted upon sleeping in the room. He remained there longer than
                        anybody else ever had done, but between two and three o'clock in <pb
                            id="VAA2427-072" n="63"/> the morning he came down the stairs with
                        barely enough strength to cling to the balustrades, and in such an ague fit
                        as I never saw any one else endure in all my life. He had served in the
                        Florida swamps and was subject to agues, but for several months before that
                        he had been free from them. I suppose the terror attacked his weakest point
                        and brought the chills on again."</p>
                    <p>"Did he have the same experience the rest had had?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, except that he had stayed longer than any of them and suffered
                        more."</p>
                    <p>"Cousin Mary," I said, "I am going to sleep in that room to-night, with your
                        permission."</p>
                    <p>"You can't have it," she answered. "I've seen too much of the terror to
                        permit a further trifling with it."</p>
                    <p>"Then I'll sleep there without your permission," I answered. "I'll break in
                        if necessary, and I'll prove by a demonstration that nobody can question,
                        what nonsense all these imaginings have been."</p>
                    <p>Cousin Mary was determined, but so was I, and at last she consented to let me
                        make the attempt. She and I decided to keep the matter to ourselves, but of
                        course it leaked out and spread among all the guests in the house. I suppose
                        the negro servants who were sent to make up the bed and supply bath water
                        told. At any rate my coming adventure was the sole topic of conversation at
                        the supper table that night.</p>
                    <p>I seized upon the occasion to give a warning.</p>
                    <p>"I have borrowed a six-shooter from our host," I announced, "and if I see
                        anything to shoot at to-night I shall shoot without challenging. So I
                        strongly advise you fellows not to attempt any practical jokes."</p>
                    <p>The response convinced me that nothing of the kind was contemplated, but to
                        make sure, our host, who perhaps feared tragedy, exacted and secured from
                        each memher <pb id="VAA2427-073" n="64"/> of the company, old and young,
                        male and female, a pledge of honor that there should be no interference with
                        my experiment, no trespass upon my privacy.</p>
                    <p>"With that pledge secured," I said, perhaps a trifle boastfully, "I shall
                        stay in that room all night no matter what efforts the spooks may make to
                        drive me out."</p>
                    <p>It was about midnight, or nearly that, when I entered the room. It was
                        raining heavily without, and the wind was rattling the stout shutters of the
                        eight great windows of the room.</p>
                    <p>I went to each of those windows and minutely examined it. They were hung with
                        heavy curtains of deep red, I remember, for I observed every detail. Four of
                        them were in the north and four in the south wall of the wing. The eastern
                        wall of the room was pierced only by the broad doorway which opened at the
                        head of the great stair:. The door was stoutly built of oak, and provided
                        with a heavy lock of iron with brass knobs.</p>
                    <p>The western side of the room held a great open fireplace, from which a
                        paneled oaken wainscot extended entirely across the room and up to the
                        ceiling. Behind the wainscot on either side was a spacious closet which I
                        carefully explored with two lighted bedroom candles to show me that the
                        closets were entirely empty.</p>
                    <p>Having completed my explorations I disrobed, double-locked the door, and went
                        to bed, first placing the six-shooter handily under my pillow. I do not
                        think I was excited even in the smallest degree. My pulses were calm, my
                        imagination no more active than a young man's must be, and my brain
                        distinctly sleepy. The great, four-poster bed was inexpressibly comfortable,
                        and the splash and patter of the rain as it beat upon the window blinds was
                        as soothing as a lullaby. I forgot all about the experiment in which I was
                        engaged, all about ghosts and their ways, and went to sleep.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-074" n="65"/>
                    <p>After a time I suddenly waked to find the room dimly pervaded by that
                        yellowish-gray or grayish-yellow light that had so disturbed the slumbers of
                        others in that apartment. My awakening was so complete that all my faculties
                        were alert at once. I felt under my pillow and found my weapon there. I
                        looked to its chambers and found the charges undisturbed. The caps were in
                        place, and I felt myself armed for any encounter.</p>
                    <p>But I had resolved in advance, to be deliberate, self-possessed, and calm,
                        whatever might happen, and I kept faith with myself. Instead of hastily
                        springing from the bed I lay there for a time watching the weird light as it
                        slowly, almost imperceptibly, increased in intensity, and trying to decide
                        whether they were right who had described as "yellowish gray" or they who
                        had called it "grayish yellow." I decided that the gray distinctly
                        predominated, but in the meanwhile the steady increase in the light and in
                        its pervasiveness warned me, and I slipped out of bed, taking my pistol with
                        me, to the dressing case on the other side of the roomthe side on which the
                        great oaken door opened.</p>
                    <p>The rain was still beating heavily against the window blinds, and the
                        strange, yellowish gray light was still slowly but steadily increasing. I
                        was resolute, however, my determination not to be disturbed or hurried by
                        any manifestation. In response to that determination I glanced at the mirror
                        and decided that the mysterious light was sufficient for the purpose, and I
                        resolved I would shave.</p>
                    <p>Having done so, I batheda little hurriedly, perhaps, because of the rapidly
                        increasing light. I was deliberate, however, in donning my clothing, and not
                        until I was fully dressed did I turn to leave the room. Glancing at every
                        object in itall now clearly visible, though some-what shadowy in outlineI
                        decided at last upon my retreat. <pb id="VAA2427-075" n="66"/> I turned the
                        key, and the bolt in the lock shot back with sound enough to startle calmer
                        nerves than mine.</p>
                    <p>I turned the knob, but the door refused to open!</p>
                    <p>For a moment I was puzzled. Then I remembered that it was a double lock. A
                        second later I was out of that chamber, and the oaken door of it was
                        securely shut behind me.</p>
                    <p>I went down the great stairway, slowly, deliberately, in pursuance of my
                        resolution; I entered the large hallway below, and thence passed into the
                        oak-wainscoted dining-room, where I sat down to breakfast with the rest of
                        the company.</p>
                    <p>It was nine o'clock of a dark, rainy morning.</p>

                    <head>XXV</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> Virginia at the time of which I am writing, everybody,
                        men, women, and children, read books and talked about them. The annual
                        output of the publishers was trifling then, as compared with the present
                        flood of new books, and as a consequence everybody read all the new books
                        and magazines, and everybody talked about them as earnestly as of politics
                        or religion. Still more diligently they read old books, the classics of the
                        language. Literature was regarded as a vital force in human affairs, and
                        books which in our time might relieve the tedium of a railway journey and be
                        forgotten at its end, were read with minute attention and discussed as
                        earnestly as if vital interests had depended upon an accurate estimation of
                        their quality.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence, authorship was held in strangely glamorous esteem. I beg
                        pardon of the English language for making that word "glamorous"; it
                        expresses <pb id="VAA2427-076" n="67"/> my thought, as no other term does,
                        and it carries its meaning on its face.</p>
                    <p>I remember that in my student days in Richmond there came a visitor who had
                        written one little bookabout Rufus Choate, I think, though I can find no
                        trace of it in bibliographies. I suspect that he was a very small author,
                        indeed, in Boston, whence he came, but he was an AUTHORwe always thought
                        that word in capital lettersand so he was dined and wined, and entertained,
                        and not permitted to pay his own hotel bills or cab charges, or anything
                        else.</p>
                    <p>Naturally a people so disposed made much of their own men of letters, of whom
                        there was quite a groupif we reckon their qualifications as generously as
                        the Virginians did. Among them were three at least whose claim to be
                        regarded as authors was beyond dispute. These were John Esten Cooke, John R.
                        Thompson, and the English novelist, G. P. R. James, who at that time was
                        serving as British consul at Richmond. And there was Mrs. Anna Cora Mowatt
                        Ritchie, who played the part of literary queen right royally.</p>
                    <p>Mr. James was a conspicuous figure in Richmond. He was a robust Englishman in
                        his late fifties, rather short and rather stout. The latter impression was
                        aided by lip the fact that in his afternoon saunterings about the town, he
                        usually wore a sort of roundabout, a coat that ended at his waist and had no
                        tails to it. To the ribald and the jocular he was known as "the Solitary
                        Horseman" because of his habit of introducing novels or chapters with a
                        lonely landscape in which a "solitary horseman" was the chief or only
                        figure. To those of us who were disposed to be deferential he was known as
                        "the Prince Regent," in memory of the jest perpetrated by one of the wits of
                        the town. Mr. James's three initials, which prompted John G. Saxe to say
                        that he "got at the font <pb id="VAA2427-077" n="68"/> his strongest claims
                        to be reckoned a man of letters"stood for "George Payne Rainsford," but he
                        rarely used anything more than the initialsG. P. R. When a certain voluble
                        gentlewoman asked Tom August what the initials stood for he promptly
                        replied:</p>
                    <p>"Why, George Prince Regent, of course. And his extraordinary courtesy fully
                        justifies his sponsors in baptism for having given him the name."</p>
                    <p>The lady lost no time in telling everybody of the interesting factand the
                        novelist became "Prince Regent James" to all his Richmond friends from that
                        hour forth.</p>
                    <p>John R. Thompson was the editor of the <hi rend="i">Southern Literary
                            Messenger.</hi> Scholar, poet, and man of most gentle mind, it is not
                        surprising that in later years, when the old life was war-wrecked, Mr.
                        William Cullen Bryant made him his intimate friend and appointed him to the
                        office of literary editor of the <hi rend="i">Evening Post,</hi> which Mr.
                        Bryant always held to be the supreme distinction possible to an American man
                        of letters. I being scarcely more than a boy studying law in the late
                        fifties, knew him only slightly, but my impression of him at that time was,
                        that with very good gifts and a certain charm of literary manner, he was not
                        yet fully grown up in mind. He sought to model himself, I think, upon his
                        impressions of N. P. Willis, and his aspiration to be recognized as a
                        brilliant man of society was quite as marked as his literary ambition. He
                        was sensitive to slights and quite morbidly apprehensive that those about
                        him might think the less of him because his father was a hatter. Socially at
                        that time and in that country men in trade of any kind were regarded as
                        rather inferior to those of the planter class.</p>
                    <p>When I knew Thompson better in after years in New York he had outgrown that
                        sort of nonsense, and was a far more agreeable companion because of the
                        fact.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-078" n="69"/>
                    <p>Chief among the literary men of Richmond was John Esten Cooke. His novel "The
                        Virginia Comedians" had made him famous in his native state, and about the
                        time I write of18589he supplemented it with another story of like kind,
                        "Henry St. John, Gentleman." As I remember them these were rather immature
                        creations, depending more upon a certain grace of manner for their
                        attractiveness than upon any more substantial merit. Certainly they did not
                        compare in vigor or originality with "Surrey of Eagle's Nest" or any other
                        of the novels their author wrote after his mind had been matured by
                        strenuous war experience. But at the time of which I write they gave him a
                        literary status such as no other Virginian of the time could boast, and for
                        a living he wrote ceaselessly for magazines and the like.</p>
                    <p>The matter of getting a living was a difficult one to him then, for the
                        reason that with a pride of race which some might think quixotic, he had
                        burdened his young life with heavy obligations not his own. His father had
                        died leaving debts that his estate could not pay. As the younger man got
                        nothing by inheritance, except the traditions of honor that belonged to his
                        race, he was under no kind of obligation with respect to those debts. But
                        with a chivalric loyalty such as few men have ever shown, John Esten Cooke
                        made his dead father's debts his own and little by little discharged them
                        with the earnings of a toilsome literary activity.</p>
                    <p>His pride was so sensitive that he would accept no help in this, though
                        friends earnestly pressed loans upon him when he had a payment to meet and
                        his purse was wellnigh empty. At such times he sometimes made his dinner on
                        crackers and tea for many days together, although he knew he would be a more
                        than welcome guest at the lavish tables of his many friends in Richmond. It
                        was a point of honor with him never to accept a dinner or other invitation
                            <pb id="VAA2427-079" n="70"/> when he was financially unable to dine
                        abundantly at his own expense.</p>
                    <p>The reviewer of one of my own stories of the old Virginia life, not long ago
                        informed his readers that of course there never were men so sensitively and
                        self-sacrificingly honorable as those I had described in the book, though my
                        story presented no such extreme example of the man of honor as that
                        illustrated in Mr. Cooke's person and career.</p>
                    <p>I knew him intimately at that time, his immediate friends being my own
                        kindred. Indeed, I passed one entire summer in the same hospitable house
                        with him.</p>
                    <p>Some years after the war our acquaintance was renewed, and from that time
                        until his death he made my house his abiding place whenever he had occasion
                        to be in New York. Time had wrought no change in his nature. He remained to
                        the end the high-spirited, duty-loving man of honor that I had known in my
                        youth; he remained also the gentle, affectionate, and unfailingly courteous
                        gentleman he had always been.</p>
                    <p>He went into the war as an enlisted man in a Richmond battery, but was soon
                        afterward appointed an officer on the staff of the great cavalier, J. E. B.
                        Stuart.</p>
                    <p>"I wasn't born to be a soldier," he said to me in after years. "Of course I
                        can stand bullets and shells and all that, without flinching, just as any
                        man must if he has any manhood in him, and as for hardship and starvation,
                        why, a man who has self-control can endure them when duty demands it, but I
                        never liked the business of war. Gold lace on my coat always made me feel as
                        if I were a child tricked out in red and yellow calico with turkey feathers
                        in my headgear to add to the gorgeousness. There is nothing intellectual
                        about fighting. It is the fit work of brutes and brutish men. And in modern
                        war, where men are organized in masses and converted into <pb
                            id="VAA2427-080" n="71"/> insensate machines, there is really nothing
                        heroic or romantic or in any way calculated to appeal to the imagination. As
                        an old soldier, you know how small a part personal gallantry plays in the
                        machine work of war nowadays."</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, John Esten Cooke was a good soldier and a gallant one. At
                        Manassas I happened to see him at a gun which he was helping to work and
                        which we of the cavalry were supporting. He was powder-blackened and he had
                        lost both his coat and his hat in the eagerness of his service at the piece;
                        but during a brief pause in the firing he greeted me with a rammer in his
                        hand and all the old cheeriness in his face and voice.</p>
                    <p>On Stuart's staff he distinguished himself by a certain laughing nonchalance
                        under fire, and by his eager readiness to undertake Stuart's most perilous
                        missions. It was in recognition of some specially daring service of that
                        kind that Stuart gave him his promotion, and Cooke used to tell with delight
                        of the way in which the great boyish cavalier did it.</p>
                    <p>"You're about my size, Cooke," Stuart said, "but you're not so broad in the
                        chest."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I am," answered Cooke.</p>
                    <p>"Let's see if you are," said Stuart, talcing off his coat as if stripping for
                        a boxing match. "Try that on."</p>
                    <p>Cooke donned the coat with its three stars en the collar, and found it a
                        fit.</p>
                    <p>"Cut off two of the stars," commanded Stuart," and wear the coat to Richmond.
                        Tell the people in the War Department to make you a major and send you back
                        to me in a hurry. I'll need you to-morrow."</p>
                    <p>When I visited him years afterwards at The Briars, his home in the Shenandoah
                        Valley, that coat which had once been Stuart's, hung upon the wall, as the
                        centerpiece <pb id="VAA2427-081" n="72"/> of a collection of war relics,
                        cherished with pride of sentiment but without a single memory that savored
                        of animosity. The gentle, courteous, kindly man of letters who cherished
                        these things as mementoes of a terrible epoch had as little in his bearing
                        to suggest the temper of the war time as had his old charger who grazed upon
                        the lawn, exempt from all work as one who had done his duty in life and was
                        entitled to ease and comfort as his reward.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> old life of the Old Dominion is a thing of the dead
                        past, a memory merely, and one so different from anything that exists
                        anywhere on earth now, that every reflection of it seems the fabric of a
                        dream. But its glamor holds possession of my mind even after the lapse of
                        half a century of years, and the greatest joy I have known in life has come
                        from my efforts to depict it in romances that are only a veiled record of
                        facts.</p>
                    <p>It was not a life that our modern notions of economics can approve, but it
                        ministered to human happiness, to refinement of mind, to culture, and to the
                        maintenance of high ideals of manhood and womanhood. It bred a race of men
                        who spoke the truth, lived uprightly, and met every duty without a shadow of
                        flinching from personal consequences. It reared a race of women fit to be
                        the wives and mothers of such men. Under its spell culture was deemed of
                        more account than mere education; living was held in higher regard than
                        getting a living; refinement meant more than display; comfort more than
                        costliness, and kindliness in every word and act more than all else.</p>
                    <p>I know an old plantation where for generations a family <pb id="VAA2427-082"
                            n="73"/> of brave men and fair women dwelt in peace and ministered in
                        gracious, hospitable ways to the joy of others. Under their governance there
                        was never any thought of exploiting the resources of the plantation for the
                        sake of a potential wealth that seemed superfluous to people of contented
                        mind who had enough. The plantation supported itself and all who dwelt upon
                        itblack and white. It educated its sons and daughters and enabled them to
                        maintain a generous hospitality. More than this they did not want or dream
                        of wanting.</p>
                    <p>There are twenty-two families living on that plantation now, most of them
                        growing rich or well-to-do by the cultivation of the little truck farms into
                        which the broad acres have been parceled out. The woodlands that used to
                        shelter the wild flowers and furnish fuel for the great open fireplaces,
                        have been stripped to furnish kindling wood for kitchen ranges in Northern
                        cities. Even the stately locust trees that had shaded the lawns about the
                        old mansion have been converted into policemen's clubs and the like, and
                        potatoes grow in the soil where greensward used to carpet the house
                        grounds.</p>
                    <p>Economically the change means progress and prosperity, of course, but to me
                        the price paid for it seems out of proportion to the goods secured. But then
                        I am old-fashioned, and perhaps, in spite of the strenuous life I have led,
                        I am a sentimentalist,and sentiment is scorned as silly in these days.</p>
                    <p>There is another aspect of the matter that deserves a word, and I have a mind
                        to write that word even at risk of anathema from all the altars of
                        sociology. At seventy years of age one is less sensitive to criticism than
                        at thirty.</p>
                    <p>All the children of the twenty-two truck farming families on that old
                        plantation go to school. They are taught enough to make out bills, add up
                        columns of figures, and <pb id="VAA2427-083" n="74"/> write business letters
                        to their commission merchants. That is what education means now on that
                        plantation and on hundreds of others that have undergone a like
                        metamorphosis. No thought or dream of culture enters into the scheme. Under
                        the old system rudimentary instruction was merely a stepping stone by which
                        to climb up to the education of culture. Under the theories of economics it
                        is a great gain thus to substitute rudimentary instruction for all in the
                        place of real education and culture for a class. But is it gain? Is the
                        world better off with ten factory hands who can read, write, and cipher,
                        than with one Thomas Jefferson or George Wythe or Samuel Adams or Chancellor
                        Livingston who knows how to think? Are ten factory girls or farmers' wives
                        the full equivalent of one cultured gentlewoman presiding gracefully and
                        graciously over a household in which the amenities of life are more
                        considered than its economics?</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the education of the race of men and women who once dwelt there has
                        correspondingly lost its culture aspect. The young men of that old family
                        are now bred to be accountants, clerks, men of business, who have no time to
                        read books and no training that leads to the habit of thinking; the young
                        women are stenographers, telegraph operators, and the like. They are
                        estimable young persons, and in their way charming. But is the world richer
                        or poorer for the change?</p>
                    <p>It is not for me to answer; I am prejudiced, perhaps.</p>
                    <p>However it may be, the old life is a thing completely dead and done for, and
                        the only compensation is such as the new affords. Everything that was
                        distinctive in that old life was burned out by the gunpowder of the Civil
                        War. Even the voices of the Virginia womenonce admired throughout the
                        landare changed. They still say "right" for "very," and "reckon" for
                        "think," and their enunciation is still marked by a certain lack of <pb
                            id="VAA2427-084" n="75"/> emphasis, but it is the voice of the peacock
                        in which they speak, not that of the dove.</p>
                    <p>Whenever I ask myself the questions set down above, I find it necessary to
                        the chastening of my mind to recite my creed:</p>
                    <p>I believe that every human being born into this world has a right to do as he
                        pleases, so long as in doing as he pleases he does not interfere with the
                        equal right of any other human being to do as he pleases;</p>
                    <p>I believe in the unalienable right of all men to life, liberty, and the
                        pursuit of happiness;</p>
                    <p>I believe that it is the sole legitimate function of government to maintain
                        the conditions of liberty and to let men alone.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, I cannot escape a tender regret when I reflect upon what we
                        have sacrificed to the god Progress. I suppose it is for the good of all
                        that we have factories now to do the work that in my boyhood was done by the
                        village carpenter, tanner, shoemaker, hatter, tailor, tinsmith, and the
                        rest; but I do not think a group of factory "hands," dwelling in repulsively
                        ugly tenement buildings and dependent upon servitude to the trade union as a
                        means of escaping enslavement by an employing corporation, mean as much of
                        human happiness or signify as much of helpful citizenship as did the
                        home-owning, independent village workmen of the past. In the same way I do
                        not think the substitution of a utilitarian smattering for all for the
                        education and culture of a class has been altogether a gain. As I see young
                        men flocking by thousands to our universities, where in earlier times there
                        were scant hundreds in attendance, I cannot avoid the thought that most of
                        these thousands have just enough education of the drill sort to pass the
                        entrance examinations and that they go to the universities, not for
                        education of the kind that brings enlargement of mind, but for technical
                        training <pb id="VAA2427-085" n="76"/> in arts that promise money as the
                        reward of their practice. And I cannot help wondering if the change which
                        relegates the Arts course to a subordinate place in the university scheme is
                        altogether a change for the better. Economically it is so, of course. But
                        economics, it seems to me, ought not to be all of human life. Surely men and
                        women were made for something more than mere earning capacity.</p>
                    <p>But all this is blasphemy against the great god Progress and heresy to the
                        gospel of Success. Its voice should be hushed in a land where fame is
                        awarded not to those who think but to those who organize and exploit; where
                        men of great intellect feel that they cannot afford to serve the country
                        when the corporations offer them so much higher salaries; and where it is
                        easier to control legislation and administration by purchase than by
                        pleading.</p>
                    <p>The old order changed, both at the North and at the South when the war came,
                        and if the change is more marked in the South than at the North it is only
                        because the South lost in the struggle for supremacy and suffered desolation
                        in its progress.</p>

                    <head>XXVII</head>
                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">HAVE</hi> elsewhere pointed out in print that Virginia did
                        not want war, or favor secession. Her people, who had already elected the
                        avowed emancipationist, John Letcher, to be their governor, voted by heavy
                        majorities against withdrawal from the Union. In her constitutional
                        convention, called to consider what the old mother state should do after the
                        Cotton States had set up a Southern Confederacy, the dominant force was
                        wielded by such uncompromising opponents of secession as Jubal A. Early,
                        Williams <pb id="VAA2427-086" n="77"/> C. Wickham, Henry A. Wise, and
                        others, who when war came were among the most conspicuous fighters on the
                        Southern side. It is important to remember that, as Farragut said, Virginia
                        was "dragooned out of the Union," in spite of the abiding unwillingness of
                        her people.</p>
                    <p>I was a young lawyer then, barely twenty-one years of age. I spoke and
                        votedmy first voteagainst the contemplated madness. But in common with the
                        Virginians generally, I enlisted as soon as war became inevitable, and from
                        the 9th of April, 1861, to the 9th of April, 1865the date of Lee's
                        surrenderI was a soldier in active service.</p>
                    <p>I was intensely in earnest in the work of the soldier. As I look back over my
                        seventy years of life, I find that I have been intensely in earnest in
                        whatever I have had to do. Such things are temperamental, and one has no
                        more control over his temperament than over the color of his eyes and
                        hair.</p>
                    <p>Being intensely in earnest in the soldier's work, I enjoyed doing it, just as
                        I have keenly enjoyed doing every other kind of work that has fallen to me
                        during a life of unusually varied activity.</p>
                    <p>I went out in a company of horse, which after brief instruction at Ashland,
                        was assigned to Stuart's First Regiment of Virginia Cavalry.</p>
                    <p>The regiment was composed entirely of young Virginians who, if not actually
                        "born in the saddle," had climbed into it so early and lived in it so
                        constantly that it had become the only home they knew. I suppose there was
                        never gathered together anywhere on earth a body of horsemen more perfectly
                        masters of their art than were the men of that First Regiment, the men whom
                        Stuart knew by their names and faces then, and whose names and faces he
                        never afterward forgot, for the reason, as he often <pb id="VAA2427-087"
                            n="78"/> said to us, that "You First Regiment fellows made me a
                        Major-General." Even after he rose to higher rank and had scores of
                        thousands of cavaliers under his command, his habit was, when he wanted
                        something done of a specially difficult and dangerous sort, to order a
                        detail from his old First Regiment to do it for him.</p>
                    <p>The horsemanship of that regiment remained till the end a model for emulation
                        by all the other cavalry, and, in view of the demonstrations of it in the
                        campaign preceding Manassas (Bull Run) it is no wonder that when the
                        insensate panic seized upon McDowell's army in that battle the cry went up
                        from the disintegrated mob of fugitives that they could not be expected to
                        stand against "thirty thousand of the best horsemen since the days of the
                        Mamelukes." The "thirty thousand" estimate was a gross exaggeration,
                        Stuart's command numbering in fact only six or seven hundred, but the
                        likening of its horsemanship to that of the Mamelukes was justified by the
                        fact.</p>
                    <p>As a robust young man who had never known a headache I keenly enjoyed the
                        life we cavalrymen led that summer. It was ceaselessly activefor Stuart's
                        vocabulary knew not the word "rest"and it was all out of doors in about as
                        perfect a summer climate as the world anywhere affords.</p>
                    <p>We had some tents, in camp, in which to sleep after we got tired of playing
                        poker for grains of corn; but we were so rarely in camp that after a little
                        while we forgot that we owned canvas dwellings, and I cannot remember, if I
                        ever knew, what became of them at last. For the greater part of the time we
                        slept on the ground out somewhere within musket shot of the enemy's lines,
                        and our waking hours were passed in playing "tag" with the enemy's scouting
                        parties, encountered in our own impertinent intrusions into the lines of our
                        foeman. A saddle was <pb id="VAA2427-088" n="79"/> emptied now and then, but
                        that was only a forfeit of the game, and the game went on.</p>
                    <p>It must have been a healthy life that we led. I well remember that during
                        that summer my company never had a man on the sick list. When the
                        extraordinary imbecility of the Confederate commissary department managed to
                        get rations of flour to us, we wetted it with water from any stream or brook
                        that might be at hand, added a little salt, if we happened to have any, to
                        the putty-like mass, fried the paste in bacon fat, and ate it as bread.
                        According to all the teachings of culinary science the thing ought to have
                        sent all of us to grass with indigestions of a violent sort; but in fact we
                        enjoyed it, and went on our scouting ways utterly unconscious of the fact
                        that we were possessed of stomachs, until the tempting succulence of
                        half-ripened corn in somebody's field set appetite a-going again and we
                        feasted upon the grain without the bother of cooking it at all.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we carried no baggage with us during the days and weeks when we
                        were absent from camp. We had a blanket apiece, somewhere, we didn't know
                        where. When our shirts were soiled we took them off and washed them in the
                        nearest brook, and if orders of activity came before they were dried, we put
                        them on wet and rode away in full confidence that they would dry on our
                        persons as easily as on a clothesline.</p>
                    <p>One advantage that I found in this neglect of impedimenta was that I could
                        always carry a book or two inside my flannel shirt, and I feel now that I
                        owe an appreciable part of such culture as I have acquired to the reading
                        done by bivouac fires at night and in the recesses of friendly cornfields by
                        day.</p>
                    <p>There were many stories current among the good women at home in those days of
                        men's lives being saved by Bibles carried in their clothes and opportunely
                        serving <pb id="VAA2427-089" n="80"/> as shields against bullets aimed at
                        their wearers' hearts. I do not know how much truth there may have been in
                        these interesting narratives, nor have I any trustworthy information upon
                        which to base an estimate of the comparative armorplate efficacy of Bibles
                        and other books. But one day, as I well remember, the impact of a bullet
                        nearly knocked me off my horse, and I found afterward that the missile had
                        deeply imbedded itself in a copy of "Tristram Shandy" which lay in the
                        region of my transverse colon. A Bible of equal thickness would doubtless
                        have served as well, but it was the ribald romance of Laurence Sterne that
                        stopped a bullet and saved my life that day.</p>
                    <p>It may be worth while to add that the young woman from whom I had borrowed
                        the book never would accept the new copy I offered to provide in exchange
                        for the wounded one.</p>
                    <p>This cavalry service abounded in adventures, most of them of no great
                        consequence, but all of them interesting at the time to those who shared in
                        them. It was an exciting game and a fascinating one to a vigorous young man
                        with enough imagination to appreciate it as I did. I enjoyed it intensely at
                        the time and, as the memory of it comes back to me now, I find warmth enough
                        still in my blood to make me wish it were all to do over again, with youth
                        and health and high spirits as an accompaniment.</p>
                    <p>War is "all hell," as General Sherman said, and as a writer during many years
                        of peace, I have endeavored to do my part in making an end of it. I have
                        printed much in illustration of the fact that war is a cruel, barbarous,
                        inhuman device for settling controversies that should be settled and could
                        be settled by more civilized means; I have shown forth its excessive
                        costliness and its unspeakable cruelty to the women and children involved
                            <pb id="VAA2427-090" n="81"/> as its victims. I have no word of that to
                        take back. But, as I remember the delights of the war game, I cannot
                        altogether regret them. I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that war, with all
                        its inhuman cruelty, its devastation, and its slaughter, calls forth some of
                        the noblest qualities of human nature, and breeds among men chivalric
                        sentiments that it is well worth while to cherish.</p>
                    <p>And the inspiration of it is something that is never lost to the soul that
                        has felt it. When the Spanish-American troubles came, and we all thought
                        they portended a real war instead of the ridiculous "muss" that followed,
                        the old spirit was so strong upon me that I enlisted a company of a hundred
                        and twenty-four men and appealed to both the state and the national
                        governments for the privilege of sharing in the fighting.</p>
                    <p>So much for psychology.</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>XXVIII</head>
                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">MONG</hi> my experiences in the cavalry service was one which
                        had a sequel that interested me.</p>
                    <p>Stuart had been promoted and Fitzhugh Lee, or "Fitz Lee" as we called him,
                        had succeeded to the command of the First Regiment.</p>
                    <p>One day he led a party of us on a scouting expedition into the enemy's lines.
                        In the course of it we charged through a strong infantry picket numbering
                        forty or fifty men. As our half company dashed through, my horse was shot
                        through the head and sank under me. My comrades rode on and I was left alone
                        in the midst of the disturbed but still belligerent picket men. I had from
                        the first made up my mind that I would never become a prisoner of war. I had
                        stomach for fighting; I was ready to endure hardship; I had no shrinking
                        from fatigue, <pb id="VAA2427-091" n="82"/> privation, exposure, or anything
                        else that falls to the lot of the soldier. But I was resolute in my
                        determination that I would never "go to jail"a phrase which fitly
                        represented my conception of capture by the enemy.</p>
                    <p>So, when my horse dropped me there in the middle of a strong picket force, I
                        drew both my pistols, took to a friendly tree, and set to work firing at
                        every head or body I could see, with intent to sell my life for the very
                        largest price I could make it command.</p>
                    <p>This had lasted for less than two minutes when my comrades, pursued by a
                        strong body of Federal cavalry, dashed back again through the picket
                        post.</p>
                    <p>As they came on at a full run Fitz Lee saw me, and, slackening speed
                        slightly, he thrust out his foot and held out his handa cavalry trick in
                        which all of us had been trained. Responding, I ized his hand, placed my
                        foot upon his and swung to his crupper. A minute later a supporting company
                        came to our assistance and the pursuing cavalrymen in blue retired.</p>
                    <p>The incident was not at all an unusual one, but the memory of it came back to
                        me years afterwards under rather peculiar circumstances. In 1889 there was
                        held in New York a spectacular celebration of the centennial of Washington's
                        inauguration as president. A little company of us who had organized
                        ourselves into a society known as "The Virginians," gave a banquet to the
                        commissioners appointed to represent Virginia on that occasion. It so fell
                        out that I was called upon to preside at the banquet, and General Fitzhugh
                        Lee, then Governor of Virginia, sat, of course, at my right.</p>
                    <p>Somewhere between the oysters and the entre I turned to him and said:</p>
                    <p>"It seemed a trifle odd to me, General, and distinctly un-Virginian, to greet
                        you as a stranger when we were presented to each other a little while ago.
                        Of course, to <pb id="VAA2427-092" n="83"/> you I mean nothing except a name
                        heard in introduction; but you saved my life once and to me this meeting
                        means a good deal."</p>
                    <p>In answer to his inquiries I began to tell the story. Suddenly he interrupted
                        in his impetuous way, asking:</p>
                    <p>"Are you the man I took on my crupper that day down there by
                        Dranesville?"</p>
                    <p>And with that he pushed back his plate and rising nearly crushed my hand in
                        friendly grasp. Then he told me stories of other meetings with his old
                        troopers,stories dramatic, pathetic, humorous,until I had need of General
                        Pryor's reminder that I was presiding and that there were duties for me to
                        do, however interesting I might find Fitzhugh Lee's conversation to be.</p>
                    <p>From that time until his death I saw much of General Lee, and learned much of
                        his character and impulses, which I imagine are wholly undreamed of by those
                        who encountered him only in his official capacities. He had the instincts of
                        the scholar, without the scholar's opportunity to indulge them. "It is a
                        matter of regret," he said to me in Washington one day, "that family
                        tradition has decreed that all Lees shall be soldiers. I have often
                        regretted that I was sent to West Point instead of being educated in a more
                        scholarly way. You know I have Carter blood and Mason blood in my veins, and
                        the Carters and Masons have had intellects worth cultivating."</p>
                    <p>I replied by quoting from Byron's "Mazeppa" the lines:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1" rend="ti-1">"'Ill betide</l>
                        <l n="2">The school wherein I learned to ride.'</l>
                        <l n="3">Quoth Charles: 'Old Hetman, wherefore so,</l>
                        <l n="4">Since thou hast learned the art so well?'"</l>
                    </lg>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-093" n="84"/>
                    <p>Instantly he responded by continuing the quotation:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1" rend="ti-1">"''Twere long to tell,</l>
                        <l n="2">And we have many a league to go</l>
                        <l n="3">With every now and then a blow;'</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>That is to say, I'm still Consul-General at Havana, and I have an appointment
                        to see the President on official business this morning."</p>
                    <p>As we were sitting in my rooms at the Arlington and not in his quarters at
                        the Shoreham, this was not a hint of dismissal, but an apology for
                        leaving.</p>
                    <p>The conversation awakened surprise in my mind, and ever since I have wondered
                        how many of the world's great men of action have regretted that they were
                        not men of thought instead, and how far the regret was justified. If Fitz
                        Lee had been educated at Yale or Harvard, what place would he have occupied
                        in the world? Would he have become a Virginian lawyer and perhaps a judge?
                        or what else? Conjecture in such a case is futile. "If" is a word of very
                        uncertain significance.</p>
                    <p>The story told in the foregoing paragraphs reminds me of another
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>When the war ended it became very necessary that I should go to Indiana with
                        the least possible delay. But at Richmond I was stopped by a peremptory
                        military order that forbade ex-Confederates to go North. The order had been
                        issued in consequence of Mr. Lincoln's assassination, and the disposition to
                        enforce it rigidly was very strong.</p>
                    <p>In my perplexity I made my way into the office of the Federal chief of staff
                        of that department. There I encountered a stalwart and impressive officer,
                        six feet, four or five inches highor perhaps even an inch or two more than
                        thatwho listened with surprising patience while I explained my necessity to
                        him. When I had done, he <pb id="VAA2427-094" n="85"/> placed his hand upon
                        my shoulder in comradely fashion and said:</p>
                    <p>"You didn't have anything to do with Mr. Lincoln's assassination. I'll give
                        you a special pass to go North as soon as you please."</p>
                    <p>I thanked him and took my leave.</p>
                    <p>In 1907forty-two years latersome one in the Authors Club introduced me to
                        "our newest member, Mr. Curtis."</p>
                    <p>I glanced at the towering form, and recognized it instantly.</p>
                    <p>"<hi rend="i">Mr.</hi> Curtis be hanged," I answered, "I know General Newton
                        Martin Curtis, and I have good reason to remember him. He is the man who let
                        me out of Richmond."</p>
                    <p>Since that time I have learned to know General Curtis well, and to cherish
                        him as a friend and club comrade as heartily as I honored him before for his
                        gallantry in war and for his ceaseless and most fruitful efforts since the
                        war in behalf of reconciliation and brotherhood between the men who once
                        confronted each other with steel between. Senator Daniel of Virginia has
                        written of him that no other man has done so much as he in that behalf, and
                        I have reason to know that the statement is not an exaggerated one. The
                        kindliness he showed to me in Richmond when we were utter strangers and had
                        only recently been foemen, inspired all his relations with the Virginians
                        during all the years that followed, and there is no man whose name to-day
                        awakens a readier response of good will among Virginians than does his.</p>

                    <head>XXIX</head>
                    <p>L<hi rend="sc">ATE</hi> in the autumn of that first year of war there was
                        reason to believe that the armies in Virginia were about to retire into the
                        dull lethargy of winter-quarters' life, and that the scene of active war was
                        to be transferred to the coast of South Carolina. The Federals had
                        concentrated heavy forces there and in a preparatory campaign had seized
                        upon the Sea Islands and their defensive works at Beaufort and elsewhere.
                        General Lee had already been sent thither to command and defend the coast,
                        and there seemed no doubt that an active winter campaign was to occur in
                        that region. I wanted to have a part in it, and to that end I sought and
                        secured a transfer to a battery of field artillery which was under orders
                        for the South.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, the active campaign never came, and for many moons we
                        led the very idlest life down there that soldiers in time of war ever led
                        anywhere.</p>
                    <p>But the service, idle as it was, played greater havoc in our ranks than the
                        most ceaseless battling could have done.</p>
                    <p>For example, we were sent one day from Charleston across the Ashley river, to
                        defend a bridge over Wappoo Cut. We had a hundred and eight men on dutyall
                        well and vigorous. One week later eight of them were dead, eight barely able
                        to answer to roll call, and all the rest in hospital. In the meanwhile we
                        had not fired a gun or caught sight of an enemy.</p>
                    <p>On another occasion we encamped in a delightful but pestilential spot, and
                        for ten days afterward our men died at the rate of from two to six every
                        twenty-four hours.</p>
                    <p>During the term of our service on that coast we were <pb id="VAA2427-096"
                            n="87"/> only once engaged in what could be called a battle. That was at
                        Pocotaligo on the 22d of October, 1862. In point of numbers engaged it was a
                        very small battle, indeed, but it was the very hottest fight I was ever in,
                        not excepting any of the tremendous struggles in the campaign of 1864 in
                        Virginia. My battery went into that fight with fifty-four men and forty-five
                        horses. We fought at pistol-shot range all day, and came out of the struggle
                        with a tally of thirty-three men killed and wounded, and with only eighteen
                        horses aliveall of them wounded but one.</p>
                    <p>General Beauregard with his own hand presented the battery a battle flag and
                        authorized an inscription on it in memory of the event. In all that we
                        rejoiced with as much enthusiasm as a company of ague-smitten wretches could
                        command, but it is no wonder that our Virginia mountaineers took on a new
                        lease of life when at last we were ordered to rejoin the Army of Northern
                        Virginia, as a part of Longstreet's artillery.</p>

                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> the end of the campaign of 1863 we found ourselves
                        unhorsed. We had guns that we knew how to use, and caissons full of
                        ammunition, but we had no horses to draw either the guns or the caissons. So
                        when Long-street was ordered south to bear a part in the campaign of
                        Chickamauga, we were left behind. After a time, during which we were like
                        the dog in the express car who had "chawed up his tag," we were assigned for
                        the winter to General Lindsay Walker's commandthe artillery of A. P. Hill's
                        corps.</p>
                    <p>We belonged to none of the battalions there, and therefore had no field
                        officers through whom to apply for <pb id="VAA2427-097" n="88"/> decent
                        treatment. For thirteen wintry days we lay at Lindsay's Turnout, with no
                        rations except a meager dole of cornmeal. Then one day a yoke of commissary
                        oxen, starved into a condition of hopeless anemia, became stalled in the mud
                        near our camp. By some hook or crook we managed to buy those wrecks of what
                        had once been oxen. We butchered them, and after twenty-four or thirty-six
                        hours of continual stewing, we had meat again.</p>
                    <p>Belonging to no battalion in the corps to which we were attached, we were a
                        battery "with no rights that anybody was bound to respect," and presently
                        the fact was emphasized. We were appointed to be the provost company of the
                        corps. That is to say, we had to build guardhouses and do all the duties
                        incident to the care of military prisoners.</p>
                    <p>The arrangement brought welcome occupation to me. As Sergeant-Major I had the
                        executive management of the military prisons and of everything pertaining to
                        them. As a lawyer who could charge no fees without a breach of military
                        etiquette, I was called upon to defend, before the courts-martial, all the
                        more desperate criminals under cur care. These included murderers,
                        malingerers, robbers, deserters, and men guilty of all the other crimes
                        possible in that time and country. They included no assailants of women. I
                        would not have defended such in any case, and had there been such our
                        sentinels would have made quick work of their disposal.</p>
                    <p>The rest, as I was convinced, were guilty, every man of them. But equally I
                        was convinced that a court-martial, if left to deal with them in its own
                        way, would condemn them whether guilty or not. To a court-martial, as a
                        rule, the accusationin the case of a private soldieris conclusive and final.
                        If not, then a very little evidenceadmissible or notis sufficient to confirm
                        it. It is the sole function of counsel before a court-martial to <pb
                            id="VAA2427-098" n="89"/> do the very little he can to secure a
                        reasonably fair trial, to persuade the officers constituting the court that
                        there is a difference between admissible evidence and testimony that should
                        not be received at all, and finally, to put in a written plea at the end
                        which may direct the attention of the reviewing officers higher up to any
                        unfairness or injustice done in the course of the trial. Theoretically a
                        court-martial is bound by the accepted rules of evidence and by all other
                        laws relating to the conduct of criminal trials; but practically the
                        court-martial, in time of war at least, is bound by nothing. It is a
                        tribunal organized to convict, and its proceedings closely resemble those of
                        a vigilance committee.</p>
                    <p>But the proceedings of every court-martial must be reduced to writing and
                        approved or disapproved by authorities "higher up." Sometimes those
                        authorities higher up have some glimmering notion of law and justice, and it
                        is in reliance upon that chance that lawyers chiefly depend in defending men
                        before courts-martial.</p>
                    <p>But no man is entitled to counsel before a court-martial. It is only on
                        sufferance that the counsel can appear at all, and he is liable to
                        peremptory dismissal at any moment during the trial.</p>
                    <p>It was under these conditions that I undertook the defense of</p>
                    <p rend="center">TOM COLLINS</p>
                    <p>Tom was an old jailbird. He had been pardoned out of the Virginia
                        penitentiary on condition that he would enlistfor his age was one year
                        greater, according to his account of it, than that at which the conscription
                        law lost its force. Tom had been a trifle less than two months in service
                        when he was caught trying to desert to the enemy. Conviction on such a
                        charge at that period of the war meant death.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-099" n="90"/>
                    <p>In response to a humble request I was permitted to appear before the
                        court-martial as Tom Collins's counsel. My intrusion was somewhat resented
                        as a thing that tended to delay in a perfectly clear case, when the court
                        had a world of business before it, and my request was very grudgingly
                        granted.</p>
                    <p>I managed, unluckily, to antagonize the court still further at the very
                        outset. I found that Tom Collins's captainwho had preferred the charges
                        against himwas a member of the court that was to try him. Against that
                        indecency I protested, and in doing so perhaps I used stronger language than
                        was advisable. The officer concerned, flushed and angry, asked me if I meant
                        to impugn his honor and integrity. I answered, in hot blood:</p>
                    <p>"That depends upon whether you continue to sit as judge in a case in which
                        you are the accuser, or whether you have the decency to retire from the
                        court until the hearing in this case is ended."</p>
                    <p>"Are you a man responsible for his words?" he flashed back in reply.</p>
                    <p>"Entirely so," I answered. "When this thing is over I will afford you any
                        opportunity you like, captain, to avenge your honor and to wreak
                        satisfaction. At present I have a duty to do toward my client, and a part of
                        that duty is to insist that you shall withdraw from the court during his
                        trial and not sit as a judge in a case in which you are the accuser. After
                        that my captain or any other officer of the battery to which I belong will
                        act for me and receive any communication you may choose to send."</p>
                    <p>At this point the presiding officer of the court ordered the room cleared
                        "while the court deliberates."</p>
                    <p>Half an hour later I was admitted again to the courtroom to hear the
                        deliberate judgment of the court that it was entirely legitimate and proper
                        for Tom's captain to sit in his case.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-100" n="91"/>
                    <p>Then we proceeded with the trial. The proof was positive that Tom Collins had
                        been caught ten miles in front, endeavoring to make his way into the enemy's
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>In answer, I called the court's attention to the absence of any proof that
                        Tom Collins was a soldier. There are only three ways in which a man can
                        become a soldier, namely, by voluntary enlistment, by conscription, or by
                        receiving pay. Tom Collins was above the conscription age and therefore not
                        a conscript. He had not been two months in service, and by his captain's
                        admission, had not received soldier's pay. There remained only voluntary
                        enlistment, and, I pointed out, there was no proof of that before the
                        court.</p>
                    <p>Thereupon the room was cleared again for consultation, and a little later the
                        court adjourned till the next morning.</p>
                    <p>When it reassembled the judge advocate triumphantly presented a telegram from
                        Governor Letcher, in answer to one sent to him. It read:</p>
                    <p>"Yes. I pardoned Collins out of penitentiary on condition of enlistment."</p>
                    <p>Instantly I objected to the reception of the despatch as evidence. There was
                        no proof that it had in fact come from Governor Letcher; it was not made
                        under oath; and finally, the accused man was not confronted by his accuser
                        and permitted to cross-examine him. Clearly that piece of paper was utterly
                        inadmissible as testimony.</p>
                    <p>The court made short work of these "lawyer's quibbles." It found Tom Collins
                        guilty and condemned him to death.</p>
                    <p>I secured leave of the court to set forth my contentions in writing so that
                        they might go to the reviewing officers as a part of the proceedings, but I
                        had very little hope of the result. I frankly told Tom that he was to be
                        shot <pb id="VAA2427-101" n="92"/> on the next Saturday but one, and that he
                        must make up his mind to his fate.</p>
                    <p>The good clergyman who acted as chaplain to the military prison then took Tom
                        in hand and endeavored to "prepare him to meet his God." After a while the
                        reverend gentleman came to me with tears of joy in his eyes, to tell me that
                        Tom Collins was "converted"; that never in the course of his ministry had he
                        encountered "a case in which the repentance was completer or more sincere,
                        or a case more clearly showing the acceptance of the sinner by his merciful
                        Saviour."</p>
                    <p>My theological convictions were distinctly more hazy than those of the
                        clerical gentleman, and my ability to think of Tom Collins as a person
                        saturated with sanctity, was less than his. But I accepted the clergyman's
                        expert opinion as unquestioningly as I could, and Tom Collins confirmed it.
                        When I visited him in the guard-house I found him positively ecstatic in the
                        sunlight of Divine acceptance which illuminated the Valley of the Shadow of
                        Death. When I mentioned the possibility that my plea in his behalf might
                        even yet prove effective, and that the sentence which condemned him to death
                        the next morning might still be revoked, he replied, with apparent
                        sincerity:</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I hope not! For then I must wait before entering into joy! But the
                        Lord's will be done!"</p>
                    <p>The next morning was the one appointed for Tom Collins's death. His coffin
                        was ready and a shallow grave had been dug to receive his body.</p>
                    <p>The chaplain and I mounted with him to the cart, and rode with him to the
                        place of execution, where three other men were to die that day. Tom's mood
                        was placidly exultant. And the chaplain alone shed tears in his behalf.</p>
                    <p>When the place of execution was reached, an adjutant came forward and read
                        three death warrants. Then he <pb id="VAA2427-102" n="93"/> held up another
                        paper and read it. It was a formal document from the War Department,
                        sustaining the legal points submitted in Tom Collins's case, disapproving
                        the finding and sentence, and ordering the man formally enlisted and
                        returned to duty.</p>
                    <p>The chaplain fell into a collapse of uncontrollable weeping. Tom Collins came
                        to his relief with the injunction: "Oh, come, now, old snuffy, cheer up!
                        I'll bet you even money I beat you to Hell yet."</p>
                    <p>That clergyman afterward confided to me his doubts of "deathbed repentances,"
                        at least in the case of habitual criminals.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the spring of 1864, the battery to which I belonged
                        mutiniedin an entirely proper and soldierlike way. Longstreet had returned,
                        and the Army of Northern Virginia was about to encounter Grant in the most
                        stupendous campaign of the war. We were old soldiers, and we knew what was
                        coming. But as we had no horses to draw our guns, and as the quartermaster's
                        department seemed unable to find horses for us, we were omitted from the
                        orders for the advance into the region of the Wilderness, where the fighting
                        was obviously to begin. We were ordered to Cobham Station, a charming region
                        of verdureclad hills and brawling streams, where there was no soldiers' work
                        to do and no prospect of anything less ignoble than provost duty.</p>
                    <p>Against this we revolted, respectfully and loyally. We sent in a protest and
                        petition asking that if horses could not be furnished for our guns, we
                        should be armed with Enfield rifles and permitted to march with our
                        battalion as a sharpshooting support.</p>
                    <p>The request was granted and from the Wilderness to <pb id="VAA2427-103"
                            n="94"/> Petersburg we marched and fought and starved right gallantly,
                        usually managing to have a place between the guns at the points of hottest
                        contest in every action of the campaign.</p>
                    <p>At Petersburg we found artillery work of a new kind to do. No sooner were the
                        conditions of siege established than our battery, because of its irregularly
                        armed condition, was chosen to work the mortars which then for the first
                        time became a part of the offensive and defensive equipment of the Army of
                        Northern Virginia.</p>
                    <p>All the fragments of batteries whose ranks had been broken up and whose
                        officers had been killed, wounded, or captured during that campaign of
                        tremendous fighting, were assigned to us for mortar service, so that our
                        numbers were swelled to 250 or 300 men. The number was fluctuating from day
                        to day, as the monotonous murder of siege operations daily depleted our
                        ranks on the one hand while almost daily there were additions made of men
                        from disintegrated commands.</p>
                    <p>I have no purpose here to write a history of that eight months of siege,
                        during which we were never for one moment out of fire by night or by day,
                        but there is one story that arose out of it which I have a mind to tell.</p>
                    <p>I had been placed in command of an independent mortar fort, taking my orders
                        directly from General E. P. AlexanderLongstreet's chief of artilleryand
                        reporting to nobody else.</p>
                    <p>Infantry officers from the lines in frontcolonels and suchused sometimes to
                        come to my little row of gunpits and give me orders in utter ignorance of
                        the conditions and limitations of mortar firing. The orders were not binding
                        upon me and, under General Alexander's instructions, I paid no heed to them,
                        wherefere I was often in a state of friction with the intermeddlers. After a
                            <pb id="VAA2427-104" n="95"/> little I discovered a short and easy
                        method of dealing with them. There was a Federal fort known to us as the
                        Railroad Iron Battery, whose commanding officer seemed a person very fond of
                        using his guns in an offensive way. He had both mortars and rifled field
                        guns, and with all of them he soon got my range so accurately that all his
                        rifle shells cut my parapet at the moment of exploding, and all his mortar
                        shells fell among my pits with extraordinary precision. In order to preserve
                        the lives of my men I had to take my stand on top of the mound over my
                        magazine whenever he began bombarding me. From that point I watched the
                        course of his mortar shells, and when one of them seemed destined to fall
                        into one of my little gun-pits, I called out the number of the pit and the
                        men in it ran into their bomb-proof till the explosion was over.</p>
                    <p>In dealing with the annoyance of intruding infantry officers, I took
                        advantage of the Railroad Iron Battery's extraordinary readiness to respond
                        to the smallest attention at my hands. A shell or two hurled in that
                        direction always brought on a condition of things which prompted my pits to
                        retreat to a covered way and suddenly remembered engagements on their own
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>Once my little ruse did not produce the intended effect. It was after sunset
                        of a day late in August. Two officers came out of the gloaming and saluted
                        me politely. They were in fatigue uniforms. That is to say, they wore the
                        light blue trousers that were common to both armies, and white duck fatigue
                        jackets that bore no insignia of rank upon their collars.</p>
                    <p>At the moment I was slowly bombarding somethingI forget what or whybut I
                        remember that I was getting no response. Presently one of my visitors
                        said:</p>
                    <p>"You seem to be having the shelling all to yourself."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-105" n="96"/>
                    <p>I resented the remark, thinking it a criticism.</p>
                    <p>"We'll see," I said. Then turning to my brother, who was my second in
                        command, I quietly gave the order:</p>
                    <p>"Touch up the Railroad Iron Battery, Joe."</p>
                    <p>Thirty seconds later the storm was in full fury about us, but my visitors did
                        not seem to mind it. Instead of retiring to the covered way, they
                        nonchalantly stood there by my side on the mound of the magazine. Every now
                        and then, between explosions, one of them would ask a question as to the
                        geography of the lines to our right and left.</p>
                    <p>"What battery is that over there?"</p>
                    <p>"What is the Federal work that lies in front of it?"</p>
                    <p>"What is the lay of the land," etc., etc.</p>
                    <p>Obviously they were officers new to this part of our line and as they offered
                        no criticism upon the work of my guns, and gave me no orders, I put aside
                        the antagonism I had felt, and in all good-fellowship explained the military
                        geography of the region round about.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, Joe had quietly stopped the fire on the Railroad Iron Battery, and
                        little by little that work ceased its activity. Finally my visitors politely
                        bade me good evening and took their leave.</p>
                    <p>I asked Joe who they were, but he did not know. I inquired of others, but
                        nobody knew. Next morning I asked at General Gracie's headquarters what new
                        troops had been brought to that part of the line, and learned that there had
                        been no changes. There and at General Bushrod Johnson's headquarters I
                        minutely described my visitors, but nobody knew anything about them, and
                        after a few days of futile conjecture I ceased to think of them or their
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>In July, 1865, the war being over, I took passage on the steamer "Lady Gay,"
                        bound from Cairo to New Orleans. There were no women on board, but there was
                            <pb id="VAA2427-106" n="97"/> a passenger list of thirty men or so. Some
                        of us were ex-Confederates and some had been Federal soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The two groups did not mingle. The members of each were polite upon
                        accidental occasion to the members of the other, but they did not
                        fraternize, at least for a timestill something happened.</p>
                    <p>I was talking one morning with some of my party when suddenly a man from the
                        other group approached as if listening to my voice. Presently he asked:</p>
                    <p>"Didn't you command a mortar fort at Petersburg?" I answered that I did,
                        whereupon he asked:</p>
                    <p>"Do you remember" and proceeded to outline the incident related above.</p>
                    <p>"Yes," I answered in astonishment, "but how do you happen to know anything
                        about it?"</p>
                    <p>"I was one of your visitors on that occasion. I thought I couldn't be
                        mistaken in the voice that commanded, 'Touch up the Railroad Iron Battery,
                        Joe.'"</p>
                    <p>"But I don't understand. You were a Federal officer, were you not?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Than what were you doing there?"</p>
                    <p>"That is precisely what my friend and I were trying to find out, while you
                        kept us for two hours under a fire of hell from our own batteries."</p>
                    <p>Then he explained:</p>
                    <p>"You remember that to the left of your position, half a mile or so away,
                        there lay a swamp. It was utterly impassable when the lines were drawn, and
                        both sides neglected it in throwing up the breastworks. Well, that swamp
                        slowly dried up during the summer, and it left something like a gap in both
                        lines, but the gap was so well covered by the batteries on both sides that
                        neither bothered to extend earthworks across it. My friend and I were in
                        charge of pickets and rifle-pits that day, and <pb id="VAA2427-107" n="98"/>
                        we went out to inspect them. SomehowI don't know howwe got lost on the
                        swamplands, and, losing our bearings, we found ourselves presently within
                        the Confederate lines. To say that we were embarrassed is to put it mildly.
                        We were scared. We didn't know how to get back, and we couldn't even
                        surrender for the reason that we were not in uniform but in fatigue dress,
                        and therefore technically, at least, in disguise. There was nothing about us
                        to show to which army we belonged. As an old soldier, you know what that
                        meant. If we had given ourselves up we should have been hanged as spies
                        caught in disguise within your lines. In our desperate strait we went to you
                        and stood there for an hour or two under the worst fire we ever endured,
                        while we extracted from you the geographical information that enabled us to
                        make our way back to our own lines under cover of darkness."</p>
                    <p>At that point he grasped my hand warmly and said: "Tell me, how is Joe? I
                        hope he is 'touching up' something that responds as readily as the Railroad
                        Iron Battery did that evening."</p>
                    <p>From that hour until we reached New Orleans, four days later, there was no
                        barrier between the two groups of passengers. We fraternized completely. We
                        told stories of our several war experiences that had no touch or trace of
                        antagonism in them.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, we exhausted the steamer "Lady Gay's" supplies of champagne and
                        cigars, and when we reached New Orleans we had a dinner together at the St.
                        Charles hotel, no observer of which would have suspected that a few months
                        before we had been doing our best to slaughter each other.</p>

                    <head>XXXII</head>
                    <p>L<hi rend="sc">ET</hi> me pass hurriedly over the years that immediately
                        followed the end of the war. I went West in search of a living. In Cairo,
                        Illinois, I became counsel and attorney "at law and in fact," for a great
                        banking, mining, steamboating, and mercantile firm, whose widely extending
                        interests covered the whole West and South.</p>
                    <p>The work was uncongenial and by way of escaping from it, after I had married,
                        I removed to Mississippi and undertook the practice of law there.</p>
                    <p>That work proved still less to my liking and in the summer of 1870 I
                        abandoned it in the profoundest disgust.</p>
                    <p>With a wife, one child, a little household furniture, and no money at all, I
                        removed to New York and secured work as a reporter on the Brooklyn <hi
                            rend="i">Union,</hi> an afternoon newspaper.</p>
                    <p>I knew nothing of the business, art, or mystery of newspaper making, and I
                        knew nothing of the city. I find it difficult to imagine a man less well
                        equipped for my new undertaking than I was. But I had an abounding
                        confidence in my ability to learn anything I wanted to learn, and I thought
                        I knew how to express myself lucidly in writing. For the rest I had tireless
                        energy and a good deal of courage of the kind that is sometimes slangily
                        called "cheek." This was made manifest on the first day of my service by the
                        fact that while waiting for a petty news assignment I wrote an editorial
                        article and sent it in to Theodore Tilton, the editor, for use. I had an
                        impulse of general helpfulness which was left unrestrained by my utter
                        ignorance of the distinctions and dignities of a newspaper office. I had a
                        thought which seemed to me to deserve editorial utterance, and with the <pb
                            id="VAA2427-109" n="100"/> mistaken idea that I was expected to render
                        all the aid I could in the making of the newspaper, I wrote what I had to
                        say.</p>
                    <p>Theodore Tilton was a man of very hospitable mind, and he cared little for
                        traditions. He read my article, approved it, and printed it as a leader.
                        Better still, he sent for me and asked me what experience I had had as a
                        newspaper man. I told him I had had none, whereupon he said
                        encouragingly:</p>
                    <p>"Oh well, it doesn't matter much. I'll have you on the editorial staff soon.
                        In the meantime, learn all you can about the city, and especially about the
                        shams and falsities of its 'Society' with a big 'S.' Study state politics,
                        and equip yourself to comment critically upon such things. And whenever you
                        have an editorial in your mind write it and send it to me."</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">Union</hi> had been purchased by Mr. Henry C. Bowen, the
                        owner of the New York <hi rend="i">Independent,</hi> then the most widely
                        influential periodical of its class in America. Theodore Tilton was the
                        editor of both.</p>
                    <p>Theodore Tilton was at the crest of the wave of success at that time, and he
                        took himself and his genius very seriously. Concerning him I shall write
                        more fully a little later on. At present I wish to say only that with all
                        his self-appreciation he had a keen appreciation of other men's abilities,
                        and he sought in every way he could to make them tributary to his own
                        success in whatever he undertook. To that end he had engaged some strong men
                        and women as members of his staff on the <hi rend="i">Union,</hi> and among
                        these the most interesting to me was Charles F. Briggs, the "Harry Franco"
                        of an earlier literary time, the associate and partner of Edgar Allan Poe on
                        the <hi rend="i">Broadway Journal,</hi> the personal friend or enemy of
                        every literary man of consequence in his time, the associate of George
                        William Curtis and Parke Godwin in the conduct <pb id="VAA2427-110" n="101"
                        /> of <hi rend="i">Putnam's Monthly;</hi> the coadjutor of Henry J. Raymond
                        on the <hi rend="i">Times,</hi> the novelist to whom Lowell dedicated "The
                        Fable for Critics," and whose personal and literary characteristics Lowell
                        set forth with singular aptitude in that poem. In brief, he was in his own
                        person a representative and embodiment of the literary life of what I had
                        always regarded as the golden age of American letters. He talked familiarly
                        of writers who had been to me cloud-haloed demigods, and made men of them to
                        my apprehension.</p>
                    <p>Let me add that though the literary life of which he had been a part was a
                        turbulent one, beset by jealousies and vexed by quarrels of a bitter
                        personal character, such as would be impossible among men of letters in our
                        time of more gracious manners, I never knew him to say an unjust thing about
                        any of the men he had known, or to withhold a just measure of appreciation
                        from the work of those with whom he had most bitterly quarreled.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps no man among Poe's contemporaries had juster reason to feel
                        bitterness toward the poet's memory than had Mr. Briggs. Yet during my
                        intimacy with him, extending over many years, I never heard him say an
                        unkind word of Poe. On the other hand, I never knew him to fail to
                        contradict upon occasion and in his dogmatic fashionwhich was somehow very
                        convincingany of the prevalent misapprehensions as to Poe's character and
                        life which might be mentioned in his presence.</p>
                    <p>It was not that he was a meekly forgiving person, for he was, on the
                        contrary, pugnacious in an unusual degree. But the dominant quality of his
                        character was a love of truth and justice. Concerning Poe and the supposed
                        immorality of his life, he once said to me, in words that I am sure I
                        remember accurately because of the impression they made on my mind:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-111" n="102"/>
                    <p>"He was not immoral at all in his personal life or in his work. He was merely
                            <hi rend="i">un</hi>moral. He had no perception of the difference
                        between right and wrong in the moral sense of those words. His conscience
                        was altogether artistic. If you had told him you had killed a man who stood
                        annoyingly in the way of your purposes, he would have thought none the worse
                        of you for it. He would have reflected that the man ought not to have put
                        himself in your way. But if you had been guilty of putting forth a false
                        quantity in verse, he would have held you to be a monster for whom no
                        conceivable punishment could be adequate."</p>
                    <p>Often Mr. Briggs's brusquerie and pugnacity were exaggerated, or even
                        altogether assumed by way of hiding a sentiment too tender to be exhibited.
                        Still more frequently the harshest things he said to his friendsand they
                        were sometimes very bitterwere prompted, not by his displeasure with those
                        who were their victims, but by some other cause of "disgruntlement." On such
                        occasions he would repent him of his fault, and would make amends, but never
                        in any ordinary way or after a fashion that anybody else would have
                        chosen.</p>
                    <p>One morning he came into the editorial room which he and I jointly occupied.
                        I bade him good-morning as usual, but he made no reply. After a little while
                        he turned upon me with some bitter, stinging utterance which, if it had come
                        from a younger man, I should have hotly resented. Coming from a man of his
                        age and distinction, I resented it only by turning to my desk and
                        maintaining silence during the entire morning. When his work was done, he
                        left the office without a word, leaving me to feel that he meant the break
                        between usthe cause of which I did not at all understandto be permanent, as
                        I certainly intended that it should. But when he entered the room next
                        morning he stood still in the middle of the <pb id="VAA2427-112" n="103"/>
                        floor, facing my back, for I had not turned my face away from my desk.</p>
                    <p>"Good-morning!" he said. "Are you ready to apologize to me?"</p>
                    <p>I turned toward him with an involuntary smile at the absurdity of the
                        suggestion, and answered:</p>
                    <p>"I don't know what I should apologize for, Mr. Briggs."</p>
                    <p>"Neither do I," he answered. "My question was prompted by curiosity. It
                        usually happens that apologies come from the person offended, you know. Are
                        you going to write on this affair in the Senate, or shall I take it up?"</p>
                    <p>From that moment his manner was what it always had been during our
                        association. Beyond what he had said he made no reference to the matter, but
                        after our work was finished he, in fact, explained his temper of the day
                        before, while carefully avoiding every suggestion that he meant to explain
                        it or that there was any connection between the explanation and the thing
                        explained.</p>
                    <p>"What do you think of servants?" he asked abruptly. I made some answer,
                        though I did not understand the reason for his question or its occasion.</p>
                    <p>"When I was in the Custom House," he resumed, "I had an opportunity to buy,
                        far below the usual price, some of the finest wines and brandies ever
                        imported. I bought some Madeira, some sherry, and some brandyten gallons of
                        each, in five-gallon demijohnsand laid them away in my cellar, thinking the
                        stock sufficient to last me as long as I lived. I rejoiced in the certainty
                        that however poor I might become, I should always be able to offer a friend
                        a glass of something really worthy of a gentleman's attention. Night before
                        last I asked my daughter to replenish a decanter of sherry which had run
                        low. She went to the cellar and presently returned with a look on <pb
                            id="VAA2427-113" n="104"/> her face that made me think she had seen a
                        burglar. She reported that there wasn't a drop of anything left in any of
                        the demijohns. I sent for some detectives, and before morning they solved
                        the riddle. A servant girl who had resigned from our service a week or two
                        before had carried all the wine and brandytwo bottlefuls at a timeto a
                        miserable, disreputable gin mill, and sold it for what the thievish
                        proprietor saw fit to give. When I learned the facts I lost my temper, which
                        was a very unprofitable thing to do. I'm late," looking at his watch, "and
                        must be off."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Briggs had a keen sense of humor, which he tried hard to disguise with a
                        shaggy seeming of dogmatic positiveness. He would say his most humorous
                        things in the tone and with the manner of a man determined to make himself
                        as disagreeable as possible.</p>
                    <p>I sat with him at a public dinner one evening. He took the wines with the
                        successive courses, but when later some one, on the other side of the table,
                        lifted his glass of champagne and asked Mr. Briggs to drink with him, he
                        excused himself for taking carbonic water instead of the wine, by
                        saying:</p>
                    <p>"I'm a rigid 'temperance' man."</p>
                    <p>When we all smiled and glanced at the red and white wine glasses he had
                        emptied in the course of the meal, he turned upon us savagely, saying:</p>
                    <p>"You smile derisively, but I repeat my assertion that I'm a strict
                        'temperance' man; I never take a drink unless I want it."</p>
                    <p>He paused, and then added:</p>
                    <p>"Temperance consists solely in never taking a drink unless you want it.
                        Intemperance consists in taking drinks when some other fellow wants
                        them."</p>
                    <p>He was peculiarly generous of encouragement to younger men, when he thought
                        they deserved it. I may <pb id="VAA2427-114" n="105"/> add that he was
                        equally generous of rebuke under circumstances of an opposite kind. I had
                        entered journalism without knowing the least thing about the profession, or
                        tradeif that be the fitter name for it, as I sometimes think it isand I had
                        not been engaged in the work long enough to get over my modesty, when one
                        day I wrote a paragraph of a score or two lines to correct an error into
                        which the New York <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> had that morning fallen. Not
                        long before that time a certain swashbuckler, E. M. Yerger, of Jackson,
                        Mississippi, had committed a homicide in the nature of a political
                        assassination. The crime and the assassin's acquittal by reason of political
                        influence had greatly excited the indignation of the entire North.</p>
                    <p>There lived at the same time in Memphis another and a very different E. M.
                        Yerger, a judge whose learning, uprightness, and high personal character had
                        made him deservedly one of the best loved and most honored jurists in the
                        Southwest. At the time of which I now write, this Judge E. M. Yerger had
                        died, and his funeral had been an extraordinary manifestation of popular
                        esteem, affection, and profound sorrow.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">Tribune,</hi> misled by the identity of their names, had
                        confounded the two men, and had that morning "improved the occasion" to hurl
                        a deal of editorial thunder at the Southern people for thus honoring a
                        fire-eating assassin.</p>
                    <p>By way of correcting the error I wrote and printed an editorial paragraph,
                        setting forth the facts simply, and making no comments.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Briggs next entered the office he took my hand warmly in both his
                        own, and said:</p>
                    <p>"I congratulate you. That paragraph of yours was the best editorial the <hi
                            rend="i">Union</hi> has printed since I've been on the paper."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-115" n="106"/>
                    <p>"Why, Mr. Briggs," I protested, "it was only a paragraph"</p>
                    <p>"What of that?" he demanded in his most quarrelsome tone. "The Lord's Prayer
                        is only a paragraph in comparison with some of the 'graces' I've heard
                        distinguished clergymen get off at banquets by way of impressing their
                        eloquence upon the oysters that were growing warm under the gaslights, while
                        they solemnly prated."</p>
                    <p>"But there was nothing in the paragraph," I argued; "it only corrected an
                        error."</p>
                    <p>"Why, sir, do you presume to tell me what is and what isn't in an article
                        that I've read for myself? You're a novice, a greenhorn in this business.
                        Don't undertake to instruct my judgment, sir. That paragraph was excellent
                        editorial writing, because it corrected an error that did a great injustice;
                        because it gave important and interesting information; because it set forth
                        facts of public import not known to our readers generally, and finally,
                        because you put that final period just where it belonged. Don't contradict
                        me. Don't presume to argue the matter. I won't stand it."</p>
                    <p>With that he left the room as abruptly as he had entered it, and with the
                        manner of a man who has quarreled and has put his antagonist down. I
                        smilingly recalled the lines in which Lowell so aptly described and
                        characterized him in "A Fable for Critics":</p>

                    <head>XXXIII</head>
                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> I first knew Theodore Tilton as my editor-in-chief,
                        on the <hi rend="i">Union,</hi> he was in his thirty-fifth year. His
                        extraordinary gifts as an effective writer and speaker had won for him, even
                        at that early age, a country-wide reputation. He was a recognized force in
                        the thought and life of the time, and he had full possession of the tools he
                        needed for his work. The <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> exercised an
                        influence upon the thought and life of the American people such as no
                        periodical publication of its class exercises in this later time of cheap
                        paper, cheap illustrations, and multitudinous magazines. Its circulation of
                        more than three hundred thousand exceeded that of all the other publications
                        of its class combined, and, more important still, it was spread all over the
                        country, from Maine to California. The utterances of the <hi rend="i"
                            >Independent</hi> were determinative of popular thought and conviction
                        in an extraordinary degree.</p>
                    <p>Theodore Tilton had absolute control of that great engine of influence, with
                        an editorial staff of unusually able men for his assistants, and with a
                        corps of contributors that included practically all the most desirable men
                        and women writers of the time.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-117" n="108"/>
                    <p>In addition to all this, it was the golden age of the lecture system, and
                        next to Mr. Beecher, Tilton was perhaps the most widely popular of the
                        lecturers.</p>
                    <p>In the midst of such a career, and possessed of such influence over the minds
                        of men, at the age of thirty-five, it is no wonder that he had a good
                        conceit of himself, and it was to his credit that he manifested that conceit
                        only in inoffensive ways. He was never arrogant, dogmatic, or overbearing in
                        conversation. His courtesy was unfailing, except in strenuous personal
                        controversy, and even there his manner was polite almost to deference,
                        however deadly the thrusts of his sarcastic wit might be. He fought with a
                        rapier always, never with a bludgeon. His refinement of mind determined
                        that.</p>
                    <p>It was an era of "gush," of phrase making, of superlatives, and in such arts
                        Tilton was peculiarly gifted. In his thinking he was bold to the limit of
                        audacity, and his aptness in clothing his thought in captivating forms of
                        speech added greatly to its effectiveness and his influence.</p>
                    <p>Radicalism was rampant at that time when the passions aroused by the recent
                        Civil War had not yet begun to cool, and Tilton was a radical of radicals.
                        So extreme was he in his views that during and after the orgies of the
                        Commune and the petroleuses in Paris, he openly espoused their cause,
                        justified their resistance to everything like orderly government, and
                        glorified those of them who suffered death for their crimes, as martyrs to
                        human liberty.</p>
                    <p>He and I were talking of these things one day, when something that was said
                        prompted me to ask him his views of the great French revolution at the end
                        of the eighteenth century. He quickly replied:</p>
                    <p>"It was a notable movement in behalf of human liberty; it was overborne by
                        military force at last only because <pb id="VAA2427-118" n="109"/> the
                        French people were unworthy of it. Robespierre was an irresolute weakling
                        who didn't cut off heads enough."</p>
                    <p>Added to his other gifts, Tilton had an impressive and attractive
                        personality. Tall, well formed, graceful in every motion, he had a head and
                        face so handsome and so unlike the common as to make him a man to be looked
                        at more than once in every company. His manner accorded with his appearance
                        and emphasized it. It was a gracious combination of deference for others
                        with an exalted self-esteem. There was a certain joyousness in it that was
                        very winning, combined with an insistent but unobtrusive self-assertion
                        which impressed without offending.</p>
                    <p>His wit was always at his command, for offense or for defense, or for mere
                        entertainment. I remember that in my first association with him I had a sort
                        of fear at each moment that he would knock me down the next with an epigram.
                        I have seen him do that repeatedly with men with whom he was at the time in
                        deadly controversy, but in my own case the fear of it was soon banished by
                        the uniform kindliness with which he treated me, and the personal affection
                        with which he seemed to regard me.</p>
                    <p>I have often wondered over his attitude toward me. I was an ex-rebel soldier,
                        and in 1870 he was still mercilessly at war with Southern men and Southern
                        ideas. My opinions on many subjects were the exact opposite of his own, and
                        I was young enough then to be insistent in the expression of my opinions,
                        especially in conversation with one to whom I knew my views to be <hi
                            rend="i">Anathema Maranatha.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Yet from the first hour of our meeting Theodore Tilton was always courteous
                        and genial toward me, and after our acquaintance had ripened a bit, he
                        became cordial and even enthusiastic in his friendship.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-119" n="110"/>
                    <p>It was his habit to rise very early, drink a small cup of coffee and, without
                        other breakfast, walk down to the office of the <hi rend="i">Union.</hi>
                        There he wrote his editorials, marked out the day's work for his
                        subordinates, and received such callers as might come, after which he would
                        walk home and take his breakfast at noon. His afternoons were spent in the
                        doing of another day's work in the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> office.
                        After our acquaintance ripened into friendship, he used to insist upon my
                        going with him to his midday breakfast, whenever my own work in any wise
                        permitted. As I also was apt to be early at the office, I was usually able
                        to accept his breakfast invitations, so that we had an hour's uninterrupted
                        intercourse almost every day. And unlike other editorial chiefs with whom I
                        have had intimate social relations in their own homes, Mr. Tilton never
                        thrust editorial or other business matters into the conversation on these
                        occasions. Indeed, he did not permit the smallest reference to such
                        subjects. If by accident such things obtruded, he put them aside as
                        impertinent to the time and place. It was not that he thought less or cared
                        less for matters of such import than other great editors do, but rather that
                        he had a well-ordered mind that instinctively shrank from confusion. When
                        engaged with editorial problems, he gave his whole attention to their
                        careful consideration and wise solution. When engaged in social intercourse
                        he put all else utterly out of his mind.</p>
                    <p>I cannot help thinking that his method as to that was a wiser one than that
                        of some others I have known, who carried the problems and perplexities of
                        their editorial work with them into their parlors, to their dinner tables,
                        and even to bed. Certainly it was a method more agreeable to his associates
                        and guests.</p>

                    <head>XXXIV</head>
                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> that time Tilton was "swimming on a sea of glory." His
                        popularity was at its height, with an apparently assured prospect of lasting
                        fame to follow. His work so far had necessarily been of an ephemeral
                        sortdealing with passing subjects in a passing waybut he had all the while
                        been planning work of a more permanent character, and diligently preparing
                        himself for its doing. One day, in more confidential mood than usual, he
                        spoke to me of this and briefly outlined a part at least of what he had
                        planned to do. But there was a note of the past tense in what he said, as if
                        the hope and purpose he had cherished were passing away. It was the first
                        intimation I had of the fact that those troubles were upon him which later
                        made an end of his career and sent him into a saddened exile which endured
                        till the end of his ruined life.</p>
                    <p>At that time I knew nothing and he told me nothing of the nature of his great
                        trouble, and I regarded his despondency as nothing more than weariness over
                        the petty annoyances inflicted upon him by some who were jealous of his
                        success and popularity.</p>
                    <p>With some of these things I was familiar. His growing liberality of thought
                        in religious matters, and the absence of asceticism from his life, had
                        brought a swarm of gadflies round his head, whose stings annoyed him, even
                        if they inflicted no serious hurt. He was constantly quizzed and criticised,
                        orally, by personal letter, and in print, as to his beliefs, his conduct,
                        his tastes, his habits, and even his employment of terms, quite as if he had
                        been a woman or a clergyman responsible to his critics and subject to their
                        censure. He maintained an appearance of good temper under all this
                        carpingmost of which was clearly inspired by "envy, malice, and all <pb
                            id="VAA2427-121" n="112"/> uncharitableness"but, as I had reason to
                        know, it stung him sorely. He said to me one day:</p>
                    <p>"It isn't the criticism that annoys me so much as the fact that I am supposed
                        to be answerable in such small ways to the bellowings of Tray, Blanche, and
                        Sweetheart. I seem not to be regarded as a free man, as other men are."</p>
                    <p>I reminded him that something of that kind was the penalty that genius and
                        popularity were usually required to pay for their privileges. I illustrated
                        my thought by adding:</p>
                    <p>"If Byron had not waked up one morning and found himself famous, he would
                        never have been hounded out of his native land by what Macaulay calls
                        British morality in one of its periodic spasms of virtue, and if Poe had
                        never written 'The Raven,' 'The Bells,' and 'Annabel Lee,' nobody would ever
                        have bothered to inquire about his drinking habits."</p>
                    <p>I strongly urged him to ignore the criticism which was only encouraged by his
                        replies to it. But in that he was not amenable to counsel, partly because
                        his over-sensitive nature was more severely stung by such criticism than
                        that of a better balanced man would have been, but still more, I think,
                        because his passion for epigrammatic reply could not resist the temptation
                        of opportunity which these things presented. Often his replies were
                        effective for the moment, by reason of their wit or their sparkling
                        audacity, but incidentally they enlarged the circle of persons offended.</p>
                    <p>Thus on one occasion, when he was challenged in print by an adversary, to say
                        that he did not drink wine, he replied in print:</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Tilton does drink wine upon sacramental and other proper occasions."</p>
                    <p>His readers smiled at the smartness of the utterance, <pb id="VAA2427-122"
                            n="113"/> but many of the more sensitive among them were deeply
                        aggrieved by what they regarded as its well-nigh blasphemous character.</p>
                    <p>I was myself present at one of his most perplexing conferences concerning
                        these matters, not as a participant in the discussion, but as a friendly
                        witness.</p>
                    <p>The quarrelfor it had developed into the proportions of a quarrelwas with the
                        Rev. Dr. Fulton, who at that time occupied a large place in public
                        attentionas a preacher of great eloquence, his friends said, as a reckless
                        sensationalist and self-advertiser, his enemies contended.</p>
                    <p>He had accused Tilton of drinking wine, and had publicly criticised him for
                        it, with great severity. Tilton had replied in an equally public way, with
                        the statement that on a certain occasion which he named, he and Dr. Fulton
                        had walked up street together after a public meeting; that at Dr. Fulton's
                        suggestion they had gone into a saloon where between them they had drunk a
                        considerable number of glasses of beer (he gave the number, but I forget
                        what it was), adding: "Of which I did not drink the major part."</p>
                    <p>Dr. Fulton was furiously angry, of course, and demanded an interview. Tilton
                        calmly invited him to call at his editorial room in the <hi rend="i"
                            >Union</hi> office. He came at the appointed time, bringing with him the
                        Rev. Dr. Armitage and two other persons of prominence. I do not now remember
                        who they were. Tilton at once sent me a message asking me to come to his
                        room. When I entered he introduced me to his visitors and then said:</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Eggleston, Dr. Fulton has called to discuss with me certain matters of
                        personal import. The discussion may result in some issues of
                        veracitydiscussions with Dr. Fulton often do. It is in view of that
                        possibility, I suppose," smiling and bowing to Dr. Fulton, who sat stiff in
                        his chair making no response by word or act, "that <pb id="VAA2427-123"
                            n="114"/> Dr. Fulton has brought with him Dr. Armitage and these other
                        gentlemen, as witnesses to whatever may be said between us. I have the
                        profoundest respect, and even reverence for those gentlemen, but it seems to
                        me proper that I should have at least one witness of my own selection
                        present also. I have therefore sent for you."</p>
                    <p>Instantly Dr. Fulton was on his feet protesting. In a loud voice and with
                        excited gesticulations, he declared that he would not be drawn into a
                        trapthat he would abandon the purpose of his visit rather than discuss the
                        matters at issue with one of Tilton's reporters present to misrepresent and
                        ridicule him in print.</p>
                    <p>Tilton, who never lost his self-possession, waited calmly till the protest
                        was fully made. Then he said:</p>
                    <p>"I have no reporter present. Mr. Eggleston was promoted a week ago to the
                        editorial writing staff of the paper. He will report nothing. You, Dr.
                        Fulton, have brought with you three friends who are of your own selection,
                        to hear the discussion between us. I claim the right to have one friend of
                        my own present also. It is solely in that capacity that I have asked Mr.
                        Eggleston to be present."</p>
                    <p>"But I will not discuss confidential matters in the presence of any newspaper
                        man," protested Dr. Fulton.</p>
                    <p>"Then in my turn," said Tilton, "I must decline to discuss the questions
                        between us, in the presence of any clergyman."</p>
                    <p>At that point Dr. Armitage and his companions remonstrated with Dr. Fulton,
                        declaring his position to be unreasonable and unfair, and telling him that
                        if he persisted in it, they would at once withdraw.</p>
                    <p>Fulton yielded, and after an hour's angry sparring on his part and placidly
                        self-possessed sword play of intellect on Tilton's side, Dr. Fulton
                        submitted a proposal of arbitration, to which Tilton assented, with one
                        qualification, <pb id="VAA2427-124" n="115"/> namely, that if the finding of
                        the arbitrators was to be published, in print, from the pulpit, or
                        otherwise, he, Tilton, should be privileged to publish also a verbatim
                        report of the <hi rend="i">testimony</hi> upon which it was founded.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Fulton rejected this absolutely, on the ground that he did not want his
                        name to figure in "a newspaper sensation."</p>
                    <p>Still cool, self-possessed, and sarcastic, Tilton asked:</p>
                    <p>"Do I correctly understand you to mean, Dr. Fulton, that you shrink from
                        sensationalism?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir, that is exactly what I mean."</p>
                    <p>"Quite a new attitude of mind to you, isn't it, Doctor? I fear it will rob
                        your preaching of much of its 'drawing' quality."</p>
                    <p>Dr. Fulton's advisers urged him to assent to Tilton's proposal as an entirely
                        reasonable one, but he persistently refused, and the conference ended with
                        nothing accomplished.</p>
                    <p>I know nothing to this day of the merits of the controversy. I have given
                        this account of the meeting called to settle it solely because it serves the
                        purpose of illustrating the methods of the two men.</p>

                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">BOUT</hi> a year later, or a little less, my editorial
                        connection with the <hi rend="i">Union</hi> ceased, and with it my official
                        association with Mr. Tilton. But he and I lived not far apart in Brooklyn
                        and from then until the great trouble broketwo or three yearsI saw much of
                        him, at his home and mine, on the street, and at many places in New York.
                        With the first open manifestation of the great trouble he began consulting
                        with me about it. I gave him a deal of good advice in response to his eager
                        demands <pb id="VAA2427-125" n="116"/> for counsel. He seemed to appreciate
                        and value it, but as he never acted upon it in the smallest degree, I
                        gradually ceased to give it even when requested.</p>
                    <p>I have every reason to believe that in the course of these consultations I
                        learned, from him and from all the others directly connected with the
                        terrible affair, the inner and true story of the events that culminated in
                        the great and widely demoralizing scandal. It is a story that has never been
                        told. At the time of the trial both sides were careful to prevent its
                        revelation, and there were certainly most imperative reasons why they
                        should.</p>
                    <p>I have no purpose to tell that story in these pages. I mention it only
                        because otherwise the abrupt termination of my reminiscences of Mr. Tilton
                        at this point might seem to lack explanation.</p>

                        the summer of 1870, I had had no newspaper experience whatever. I had
                        written for newspapers occasionally, but only as an amateur. I had published
                        one or two small things in magazines, but I knew absolutely nothing of
                        professional newspaper work. Mr. Tilton and his managing editor, Kenward
                        Philp, were good enough to find in my earliest work as a reporter some
                        capacity for lucid expression, and a simple and direct narrative habit which
                        pleased them, so that in spite of my inexperience they were disposed to give
                        me a share in the best assignments. I may say incidentally that among the
                        reporters I was very generally pitied as a poor fellow foredoomed to failure
                        as a newspaper man for the reason that I was what we call educated. At that
                        time, though not for long afterwards, education and a tolerable regularity
                        of life were regarded <pb id="VAA2427-126" n="117"/> as serious handicaps in
                        the newsrooms of most newspapers.</p>
                    <p>Among my earliest assignments was one which brought me my first experience of
                        newspaper libel suits, designed not for prosecution but as a means of
                        intimidating the newspaper concerned. The extent to which the news of the
                        suit appalled me was a measure of my inexperience, and the way in which it
                        was met was a lesson to me that has served me well upon many later occasions
                        of the kind.</p>
                    <p>A man whom I will call Amour, as the use of his real name might give pain to
                        innocent persons even after the lapse of forty years, was express agent at a
                        railway station in the outskirts of Brooklyn. His reputation was high in the
                        community and in the church as a man of exemplary conduct and a
                        public-spirited citizen, notably active in all endeavors for the betterment
                        of life.</p>
                    <p>It was a matter of sensational, popular interest, therefore, when his wife
                        instituted divorce proceedings, alleging the most scandalous conduct on his
                        part.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">Union</hi> was alert to make the most of such things and
                        Kenward Philp set me to explore this case and exploit it. He told me frankly
                        that he did so because he thought I could "write it up" in an effective way,
                        but he thought it necessary to caution my inexperience that I must confine
                        my report rigidly to the matter in hand, and not concern myself with side
                        issues of any kind.</p>
                    <p>In the course of my inquiry, I learned much about Amour that was far more
                        important than the divorce complications. Two or three business men of high
                        repute in Brooklyn told me without reserve that he had abstracted money from
                        express packages addressed to them and passing through his hands. When
                        detected by them he had made good the losses, and in answer to his pleadings
                        in behalf of his wife and children, they had kept silence. But now that he
                        had himself brought ruin and disgrace <pb id="VAA2427-127" n="118"/> upon
                        his family they had no further reason for reserve. I secured written and
                        signed statements of the facts from each of them, with permission to publish
                        if need be. But all this was aside from the divorce matter I had been set to
                        investigate, and, mindful of the instructions given me, I made no mention of
                        it in the article.</p>
                    <p>When I reached the office on the morning after that article was published, I
                        met Kenward Philp at the entrance door of the building, manifestly waiting
                        for me in some anxiety. Almost forgetting to say "good-morning," he eagerly
                        asked:</p>
                    <p>"Are you sure of your facts in that Amour storycan they be proved?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, absolutely," I replied. "But why do you ask?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, only because Amour has served papers on us in a libel suit for fifty
                        thousand dollars damages."</p>
                    <p>My heart sank at this, as it had never done before, and has never done since.
                        I regarded it as certain that my career in the new profession I had adopted
                        was hopelessly ended at its very beginning, and I thought, heart-heavily, of
                        the wife and baby for whom I saw no way to provide.</p>
                    <p>"Why, yes," I falteringly repeated, "every statement I made can be supported
                        by unimpeachable testimony. But, believe me, Mr. Philp, I am sorry I have
                        got the paper into trouble."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, that's nothing," he replied, "so long as you're sure of your facts. One
                        libel suit more or less is a matter of no moment."</p>
                    <p>Then, by way of emphasizing the unworthiness of the man I had "libeled" I
                        briefly outlined the worse things I had learned about him. Philp fairly
                        shouted with delight:</p>
                    <p>"Keno!" he exclaimed. "Hurry upstairs and <hi rend="i">libel him some
                            more!</hi> Make it strong. Skin him and dress the wound with <hi
                            rend="i">aqua fortis</hi>I sayand rub it in!"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-128" n="119"/>
                    <p>I obeyed with a will, and the next morning Amour was missing, and the express
                        company was sending descriptions of him to the police of every city in the
                        country. It is a fixed rule with the great express companies to prosecute
                        relentlessly every agent of their own who tampers with express packages. It
                        is a thing necessary to their own protection. So ended my first libel
                        suit.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>XXXVII</head>
                    <p>D<hi rend="sc">URING</hi> the many years that I passed in active newspaper
                        work after that time, observation and experience taught me much, with regard
                        to newspaper libel suits, which is not generally known. It may be of
                        interest to suggest some things on the subject here.</p>
                    <p>I have never known anybody to get rich by suing newspapers for libel. The
                        nearest approach to that result that has come within my knowledge was when
                        Kenward Philp got a verdict for five thousand dollars damages against a
                        newspaper that had accused him of complicity in the forging of the
                        celebrated Morey letter which was used to General Garfield's hurt in his
                        campaign for the Presidency. There have been larger verdicts secured in a
                        few other cases, but I suspect that none of them seemed so much like
                        enrichment to those who secured them, as that one did to Philp. It was not
                        Mr. Philp's habit to have a considerable sum of money in possession at any
                        time. His temperament strongly militated against that, and I think all men
                        who knew him well will agree with me in doubting that he ever had one-half
                        or one-fourth the sum this verdict brought him, in his possession at any one
                        time in his life, except upon that occasion.</p>
                    <p>In suing newspapers for libel it is the custom of suitors to name large sums
                        as the measure of the damages <pb id="VAA2427-129" n="120"/> claimed, but
                        this is a thing inspired mainly by vanity and a spirit of ostentation. It
                        emphasizes the value of the reputation alleged to have been damaged; it is
                        in itself a boastful threat of the punishment the suitor means to inflict,
                        and is akin to the vaporings with which men of rougher ways talk of the
                        fights they contemplate. It is an assurance to the friends of the suitor of
                        his determined purpose to secure adequate redress and of his confidence in
                        his ability to do so. Finally, it is a "don't-tread-on-me" warning to
                        everybody concerned.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by such motives men often sue for fifty thousand dollars for damages
                        done to a fifty-cent reputation. It costs no more to institute a suit for
                        fifty thousand dollars than to bring one for one or two thousand.</p>
                    <p>In many cases libel suits are instituted without the smallest intention of
                        bringing them to trial. They are "bluffs," pure and simple. They are meant
                        to intimidate, and sometimes they accomplish that purpose, but not
                        often.</p>
                    <p>I remember one case with which I had personally to deal. I was in charge of
                        the editorial page of the New York <hi rend="i">World</hi> at the time, and
                        with a secure body of facts behind me I wrote a severe editorial concerning
                        the male-factions of one John Y. McKane, a Coney Island political boss. I
                        specifically charged him with the crimes he had committed, cataloguing them
                        and calling each of them by its right name.</p>
                    <p>The man promptly served papers in a libel suit against the newspaper. A timid
                        business manager hurriedly came to me with the news, asking if I couldn't
                        write another article "softening" the severity of the former utterance. I
                        showed him the folly of any such attempt in a case where the libel, if there
                        was any libel, had already been published.</p>
                    <p>"But even if the case were otherwise," I added, "the <hi rend="i">World</hi>
                        will do nothing of that cowardly kind. The man <pb id="VAA2427-130" n="121"
                        /> has committed the crimes we have charged. Otherwise we should not have
                        made the charges. I shall indite and publish another article specifically
                        reiterating our accusations, as our reply to his attempt at
                        intimidation."</p>
                    <p>I did so at once. I repeated each charge made and emphasized it. I ended the
                        article by saying that the man had impudently sued the paper for libel in
                        publishing these truths concerning him, and adding that "it is not as
                        plaintiff in a libel suit that he will have to meet these accusations, but
                        as defendant in a criminal prosecution, and long before his suit for libel
                        can be brought to trial, he will be doing time in prison stripes with no
                        reputation left for anybody to injure."</p>
                    <p>The prediction was fulfilled. The man was prosecuted and sentenced to a long
                        term in state's prison. So ended that libel suit.</p>
                    <p>The queerest libel proceeding of which I ever had personal knowledge, was
                        that of Judge Henry Hilton against certain members of the staff of the New
                        York <hi rend="i">World.</hi> It was unusual in its inception, in its
                        character, and in its outcome.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">World</hi> published a series of articles with regard to
                        Judge Hilton's relations with the late A. T. Stewart, and with the fortune
                        left by Mr. Stewart at his death. I remember nothing of the merits of the
                        matter, and they need not concern us here. The <hi rend="i">Wordl</hi>
                        wanted Judge Hilton to bring a libel suit against it, in the hope that at
                        the trial he might take the witness-stand and submit himself to
                        cross-examination. To that end the paper published many things which were
                        clearly libelous if they were not true.</p>
                    <p>But Judge Hilton was not to be drawn into the snare. He instituted no libel
                        suit in his own behalf; he asked no redress for statements made about
                        himself, but he made complaint to the District Attorney, Colonel John R.
                        Fellows, <pb id="VAA2427-131" n="122"/> that the <hi rend="i">World</hi> had
                        criminally libeled the <hi rend="i">memory of A. T. Stewart,</hi> and for
                        that offense Col. Fellows instituted criminal proceedings against John A.
                        Cockerill and several other members of the <hi rend="i">World's</hi> staff,
                        who thus learned for the first time that under New York's queer libel law it
                        is a crime to say defamatory things of Benedict Arnold, Guy Fawkes, or the
                        late Judas Iscariot himself unless you can prove the truth of your
                        charges.</p>
                    <p>The editors involved in this case were held in bail, but as no effort of
                        their attorneys to secure their trial could accomplish that purpose, it
                        seems fair to suppose that the proceedings against them were never intended
                        to be seriously pressed.</p>
                    <p>Finally, when the official term of Colonel Fellows drew near its end, Mr. De
                        Lancy Nicoll was elected to be his successor as District Attorney. As Mr.
                        Nicoll had been the attorney of the <hi rend="i">World</hi> and of its
                        accused editors, the presence of these long dormant cases in the District
                        Attorney's office threatened him with a peculiarly sore embarrassment.
                        Should he find them on his calendar upon taking office, he must either
                        become the prosecutor in cases in which he had been defendants' counsel, or
                        he must dismiss them at risk of seeming to use his official authority to
                        shield his own former clients from due responsibility under the criminal
                        law.</p>
                    <p>It was not until the very day before Mr. Nicoll took office that the
                        embarrassing situation was relieved by Colonel Fellows, who at the end of
                        his term went into court and asked for the dismissal of the cases.</p>
                    <p>One other thing should be said on this subject. There are cases, of course,
                        in which newspapers of the baser sort do wantonly assail reputation and
                        should be made to smart for the wrong done. But these cases are rare. The
                        first and most earnest concern of every reputable newspaper is to secure
                        truth and accuracy in its news reports, and <pb id="VAA2427-132" n="123"/>
                        every newspaper writer knows that there is no surer way of losing his
                        employment and with it his chance of securing another than by falsifying in
                        his reports. The conditions in which newspapers are made render mistakes and
                        misapprehensions sometimes unavoidable; but every reputable newspaper holds
                        itself ready to correct and repair such mistakes when they injure or annoy
                        innocent persons. Usually a printed retraction with apology in fact repairs
                        the injury. But I have known cases in which vindictiveness, or the hope of
                        money gain, has prompted the aggrieved person to persist in suing for
                        damages and rejecting the offer of other reparation. In such cases the
                        suitors usually secure a verdict carrying six cents damages. In one case
                        that I remember the jury estimated the damages at one centleaving the
                        plaintiff to pay the costs of the proceeding.</p>

                        to me an unusual opportunity, involving a somewhat dramatic experience.</p>
                    <p>The internal revenue tax on distilled spirits was then so high as to make of
                        illicit distilling an enormously profitable species of crime. The business
                        had grown to such proportions in Brooklyn that its flourishing existence
                        there, practically without interference by the authorities, gave rise to a
                        very damaging political scandal.</p>
                    <p>In the region round the Navy Yard there were illicit stills by scores,
                        producing spirits by thousands of gallons daily. They were owned by
                        influential men of standing, but operated by men of desperate criminal
                        character to whom homicide itself seemed a matter of indifference so long as
                        its perpetration could conceal crime or secure <pb id="VAA2427-133" n="124"
                        /> protection from punishment by means of the terror the "gang" held over
                        the heads of all who might interfere with its members or their nefarious
                        business.</p>
                    <p>It was a dangerous thing to meddle with, and the officers of the lawafter
                        some of them had been killed and others severely beatenwere in fact afraid
                        to meddle with it. There were warrants in the United States Marshal's office
                        for the arrest of nearly a score of the offenders, but the papers were not
                        served and there was scarcely a pretense made of effort to serve them.</p>
                    <p>It was made my duty to deal with this matter both in the news columns and
                        editorially. Every day we published a detailed list of the stills that had
                        been in operation during the preceding night, together with the names of the
                        men operating each and detailed information as to the exact locality of
                        each. Every day we printed editorial articles calling upon the officers of
                        the law to act, and severely criticising their cowardice in neglecting to
                        act. At first these editorial utterances were admonitory and critical. With
                        each day's added demonstration of official weakness they grew severer and
                        more denunciatory of the official cowardice or corruption that alone could
                        have inspired the inactivity. Presently the officer chiefly responsible,
                        whom the newspaper singled out by name as the subject of its criticism, and
                        daily denounced or ridiculed, instituted the usual libel suit for purposes
                        of intimidation only.</p>
                    <p>It had no such effect. The newspaper continued its crusade, and the scandal
                        of official neglect grew daily in the public mind, until presently it
                        threatened alarming political results.</p>
                    <p>I do not know that political corruption was more prevalent then than now, but
                        it was more open and shameless, and as consequence men of upright minds were
                        readier to suspect its existence in high places. At this time such <pb
                            id="VAA2427-134" n="125"/> men began rather insistently to ask why the
                        authorities at Washington did not interfere to break up the illicit stills
                        and why the administration retained in office the men whose neglect of that
                        duty had become so great a scandal. It was freely suggested that somebody at
                        Washington must be winking at the lawlessness in aid of political purposes
                        in Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p>It was then that Theodore Tilton, with his constitutional audacity, decided
                        to send me to Washington to interview President Grant on the subject. I was
                        provided with letters from Tilton, as the editor of the Republican newspaper
                        of Brooklyn, from the Republican Postmaster Booth, and from Silas B. Dutcher
                        and other recognized leaders of the Republican party in Brooklyn. These
                        letters asked the President, in behalf of Republicanism in Brooklyn, to give
                        me the desired interview, assuring him of my integrity, etc.</p>
                    <p>So armed I had no difficulty in securing audience. I found General Grant to
                        be a man of simple, upright mind, unspoiled by fame, careless of formalities
                        and the frills of official place, in no way nervous about his dignityjust a
                        plain, honest American citizen, accustomed to go straight to the marrow of
                        every subject discussed, without equivocation or reserve and apparently
                        without concern for anything except truth and justice.</p>
                    <p>He received me cordially and dismissed everybody else from the room while we
                        talked. He offered me a cigar and we had our conference without
                        formality.</p>
                    <p>In presenting my credentials, I was moved by his own frankness of manner to
                        tell him that I was an ex-Confederate soldier and not a Republican in
                        politics. I was anxious not to sail under false colors, and he expressed
                        himself approvingly of my sentiment, assuring me that my personal views in
                        politics could make no difference in my status on this occasion.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-135" n="126"/>
                    <p>After I had asked him a good many questions about the matter in hand, he
                        smilingly asked:</p>
                    <p>"Why don't you put the suggestions so vaguely mentioned in these letters,
                        into a direct question, so that I may answer it?"</p>
                    <p>It had seemed to me an impossible impudence to ask the President of the
                        United States whether or not his administration was deliberately protecting
                        crime for the sake of political advantage, but at his suggestion I
                        formulated the question, hurriedly putting it in writing for the sake of
                        accuracy in reporting it afterwards. He answered it promptly and directly,
                        adding:</p>
                    <p>"I wish you would come to me again a week from today. I may then have a more
                        conclusive answer to give you. Come at any rate."</p>
                    <p>When the interview was published, my good friend, Dr. St. Clair McKelway,
                        then young in the service on the Brooklyn <hi rend="i">Eagle</hi> which has
                        since brought fame to him and extraordinary influence to the newspaper which
                        he still conducts, said to me at a chance meeting: "I think your putting of
                        that question to General Grant was the coolest and most colossal piece of
                        impudence I ever heard of."</p>
                    <p>So it would have been, if I had done the thing of my own motion or otherwise
                        without General Grant's suggestion, a thing of which, of course, no hint was
                        given in the published interview.</p>
                    <p>When I saw the President again a week later, he needed no questioning on my
                        part. He had fully informed himself concerning matters in Brooklyn, and knew
                        what he wanted to say. Among other things he mentioned that he had had a
                        meeting with the derelict official whom we had so severely criticised and
                        who had responded with a libel suit. All that the President thought it
                        necessary to say concerning him was:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-136" n="127"/>
                    <p>"He must go. You may say so from me. Say it in print and positively."</p>
                    <p>The publication of that sentence alone would have made the fortune of my
                        interview, even without the other utterances of interest that I was
                        authorized to publish as an assurance that the administration intended to
                        break up the illicit distilling in Brooklyn even if it required the whole
                        power of the government to do it.</p>
                    <p>In relation to that matter the President said to me:</p>
                    <p>"Now for your own reassurance, and not for publication, I may tell you that
                        as soon as proper preparations can be made, the distilling district will be
                        suddenly surrounded by a cordon of troops issuing from the Navy Yard, and
                        revenue officers, under command of Jerome B. Wass, whom you know, I believe,
                        will break up every distillery, carry away every still and every piece of
                        machinery, empty every mash-tub into the gutters, and arrest everybody
                        engaged in the business."</p>
                    <p>I gave my promise not to refer to this raid in any way in advance of its
                        making, but asked that I might be permitted to be present with the revenue
                        officers when it should be made. General Grant immediately sent for Mr.
                        Wass, who was in the White House at the time, and directed him to inform me
                        when he should be ready to make the raid, and to let me accompany him. To
                        this he added: "Don't let any other newspaper man know of the thing."</p>
                    <p>The raid was made not long after that. In the darkness of the end of a nighta
                        darkness increased by the practice of the distillers of extinguishing all
                        the street lamps in that regiona strong military force silently slipped out
                        of a remote gate in the Navy Yard inclosure, and before the movement was
                        suspected, it had completely surrounded the district, under orders to allow
                        no human being to pass in or out through the lines. I had with me <pb
                            id="VAA2427-137" n="128"/> an assistant, whom I had found the night
                        before at a ball that he had been assigned to report, and under the strict
                        rule laid down for the military, he and I were the only newspaper men within
                        the lines, or in any wise able to secure news of what was going ona matter
                        that was exciting the utmost curiosity throughout the city. On the other
                        hand, the rigidity of the military cordon threatened to render our presence
                        within the lines of no newspaper use to us. Ours was an afternoon newspaper
                        and our "copy," of which we soon made many columns, must be in the office
                        not very long after midday if it was to be of any avail. But we were not
                        permitted to pass the lines with it, either in person or by messenger. At
                        last we secured permission of the Navy Yard authorities to go down to the
                        water front of the Yard and hail a passing tug. With our pockets stuffed
                        full of copy, we passed in that way to the Manhattan shore and made our way
                        thence by Fulton ferry to the office, where we were greeted as heroes and
                        victors who had secured for the paper the most important "beat" that had
                        been known in years.</p>
                    <p>There are victories, however, that are more disastrous to those who win them
                        than defeat itself. For a time this one threatened to serve me in that way.
                        Mr. Bowen, the owner of the paper, whom I had never before seen at the <hi
                            rend="i">Union</hi> office, presented himself there the next morning,
                        full of enthusiasm. He was particularly impressed by the way in which I had
                        secured advance information of the raid and with it the privilege of being
                        present to report the affair. Unfortunately for me, he said in his
                        enthusiasm, "that's the sort of man we make a general and not a private of
                        in journalism."</p>
                    <p>Newspaper employments of the better sort were not easy to get in those days,
                        and my immediate superiors in the office interpreted Mr. Bowen's utterance
                        to mean that <pb id="VAA2427-138" n="129"/> he contemplated the removal of
                        some one or other of them, to make a commanding place for me. He had even
                        suggested, in plain words, that he would like to see me made managing
                        editor.</p>
                    <p>In that suggestion he was utterly wrong. I knew myself to be unfit for the
                        place for the reason that I knew little of the city and almost nothing of
                        journalism, in which I had been engaged for no more than a few weeks.
                        Nevertheless, Mr. Bowen's suggestion aroused the jealousy of my immediate
                        superiors, and they at once began a series of persecutions intended to drive
                        me off the paper, a thing that would have been calamitous to a man rather
                        inexperienced and wholly unknown in other newspaper offices.</p>
                    <p>Theodore Tilton solved the problem by removing me from the news department
                        and promoting me to the editorial writing staff.</p>

                        newspaper my connection with it was severed, and for a time I was a "free
                        lance," writing editorials and literary articles of various kinds for the
                        New York <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> in the forenoons, and devoting the
                        afternoons to newswork on the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>writing "on space"
                        for both.</p>
                    <p>At that time Mr. William Cullen Bryant was traveling somewhere in the South,
                        I think, so that I did not then become acquainted with him. That came
                        later.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> was in charge of the late Charlton T.
                        Lewis, with whom, during many later years, I enjoyed an intimate
                        acquaintance. Mr. Lewis was one of the ripest scholars and most diligent
                        students I have ever known, but he was also a man of broad human sympathies,
                            <pb id="VAA2427-139" n="130"/> intensely interested in public affairs
                        and in all else that involved human progress. His knowledge of facts and his
                        grasp of principles in the case of everything that interested him seemed to
                        me not less than extraordinary, and they seem so still, as I remember the
                        readiness with which he would turn from consideration of some nice question
                        of Greek or Latin usage to write of a problem of statesmanship under
                        discussion at Washington, or of some iniquity in municipal misgovernment
                        which occupied the popular mind. His eyes were often red after the scholarly
                        vigils of the midnight, but they were wide open and clear-sighted in their
                        survey of all human affairs, from the Old Catholic movement to police
                        abuses. His scholarship in ancient literatures in no way interfered with his
                        alert interest in the literature of his own language, his own country, and
                        his own time, or with his comprehensive acquaintance with it.</p>
                    <p>He was as much at home on the rostrum as at the desk, and his readiness and
                        force in speaking were as marked as the effectiveness of his written words.
                        More remarkable still, perhaps, was the fact that his oral utterances,
                        however unexpectedly and extemporaneously he might be called upon to speak,
                        were as smoothly phrased, as polished, and as perfectly wrought in every way
                        as if they had been carefully written out and laboriously committed to
                        memory.</p>
                    <p>Personally he was genial, kindly, and courteous, not with the courtesy of
                        courtliness, which has considerations of self for its impulse, but with that
                        of good-fellowship, inspired by concern for the happiness of those with whom
                        he came in contact.</p>

                        interested me particularly. My impulse was strongly toward the literary side
                        of newspaper work, and it was on that side chiefly that the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post</hi> gave me opportunity. But I was working there only on
                        space and devoting the greater part of my time to less congenial tasks. In a
                        little while I gave up both these employments to accept the position of
                        managing editor of a weekly illustrated publication called <hi rend="i"
                            >Hearth and Home.</hi> The paper had been very ambitious in its
                        projection, very distinguished in the persons of its editors and
                        contributors, and a financial failure from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>There were several reasons for this. The mere making of an illustrated
                        periodical in those days was excessively expensive. There were no
                        photographic processes for the reproduction of pictures at that time. Every
                        illustration must be drawn on wood and engraved by hand at a cost ten or
                        twenty times as great as that now involved in the production of a similar
                        result.</p>
                    <p>A second difficulty was that <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> was originally
                        designed to meet a demand that did not exist. It was meant to be a country
                        gentleman's newspaper at a time when there were scarcely any country
                        gentlemenin the sense intendedin America. Its appeals were largely to a
                        leisure-class of well-to-do people, pottering with amateur horticulture and
                        interested in literature and art.</p>
                    <p>It had for its first editors Donald G. Mitchell (Ik Marvel), Mrs. Harriet
                        Beecher Stowe, and Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge. Mrs. Dodge was the only one of the
                        company who had the least capacity as an editor, and her work was confined
                        to the children's pages. The others <pb id="VAA2427-141" n="132"/> were
                        brilliant and distinguished literary folk, but wholly without either
                        experience or capacity as editors.</p>
                    <p>The publication had lost a fortune to its proprietors, when it was bought by
                        Orange Judd &amp; Company, the publishers of the <hi rend="i">American
                            Agriculturist.</hi> They had changed its character somewhat, but not
                        enough to make it successful. Its circulationnever largehad shrunk to a few
                        thousands weekly. Its advertisements were few and unremunerative; and its
                        total income was insufficient to cover one-half the cost of making it.</p>
                    <p>My brother, Edward, and I were employed to take control of the paper and, if
                        possible, resuscitate it. We found a number of "Tite Barnacles" there
                        drawing extravagant salaries for which their services made no adequate
                        return. To rid the paper of these was Edward's first concern. We found the
                        pigeonholes stuffed with accepted manuscripts, not one in ten of which was
                        worth printing. They were the work of amateurs who had nothing to say and
                        didn't at all know how to say it. These must be paid for, as they had been
                        accepted, but to print them would have been to invite continued failure. By
                        my brother's order they were dumped into capacious waste baskets and better
                        materials secured from writers of capacityamong them such persons as Dr.
                        Edward Everett Hale, Asa Gray, George E. Waring, Jr., Charles Barnard, Mrs.
                        Runkle, Helen Hunt, Rebecca Harding Davis, Sara Orne Jewett, Harriet
                        Prescott Spofford, Rose Terry, and others of like ability.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Dodge continued her well-nigh matchless work as editor of the children's
                        pages, until a year or so later, when she left <hi rend="i">Hearth and
                            Home</hi> to create the new children's magazine, <hi rend="i">St.
                            Nicholas.</hi> She was a woman of real geniusa greatly overworked word,
                        but one fitly applied in her case. Her editorial instincts were alert and
                        unfailing. Her gift of discovering kernels of value in <pb id="VAA2427-142"
                            n="133"/> masses of chaff was astonishing, and her skill in revising and
                        reconstructing so as to save the grain and rid it of the chaff was such as I
                        have never known in any other editor.</p>
                    <p>Her industry was at times almost appalling in its tireless energy, yet it
                        seemed to make no draughts upon her vitality that her singularly buoyant
                        nature could not meet without apparent strain.</p>
                    <p>She had also a rare gift of recognizing ability in others, judging it
                        accurately, and setting it to do its proper work. One of the greatest
                        services she rendered <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> was in suggesting
                        Frank R. Stockton for employment on the staff when we found ourselves in
                        need of an assistant. He had not begun to make his reputation then. Such
                        newspaper work as he had found to do had afforded his peculiar gifts no
                        adequate opportunity and outside a narrow circle he was wholly unknown. But
                        Mrs. Dodge was right in her reckoning when she advised his employment, and
                        equally right in her perception of the kind of opportunity he needed.</p>
                    <p>The friendship between Stockton and myself, which was begun during the time
                        of our association on <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi>, endured and
                        increased to the end of his life. The fame that those later years brought to
                        him is a matter of familiar knowledge to all who are likely to read this
                        book. It is not of that that I wish to write here, or of the character of
                        the work by which that fame was won. It is only of Stockton the man that I
                        need set down anything in these pages.</p>
                    <p>He was the best of good company always, as I found out early in our
                        association, in those days when we went out together for our luncheon every
                        day and enjoyed an hour of relaxation between the long morning's work and
                        that of the longer afternoon. He never failed to be ready to go when the
                        luncheon hour came. His work was always <pb id="VAA2427-143" n="134"/> in
                        shape and he carried no care for it with him when we quitted the office
                        together. He never talked shop. I cannot remember that he ever mentioned
                        anything respecting his work or asked a question concerning it between the
                        time of our leaving the office and that of our return.</p>
                    <p>Not that he was indifferent to it, for on the contrary I never knew a more
                        conscientious worker, or one who more faithfully attended to every detail.
                        When his "copy" was laid on my desk I knew perfectly that every sentence was
                        as he had intended it to be, that every paragraph break was made at the
                        point he desired it to be, and that every comma was marked in its proper
                        place. While engaged in doing his work he gave his undivided attention to
                        it, but when he went with me to the Crooked Steep house in Trinity Alley for
                        his luncheon, he gave equal attention to the mutton and potatoes, while his
                        conversation was of things light, airy, and not strenuous.</p>
                    <p>I speke of this to him one day many years after the time of our editorial
                        association, and for answer he said:</p>
                    <p>"I suppose there are men who can part their hair and polish their boots at
                        the same time, but I am not gifted in that way."</p>
                    <p>I never saw Stockton angry. I doubt that he ever was so. I never knew him to
                        be in the least degree hurried, or to manifest impatience in any way. On the
                        other hand, I never knew him to manifest enthusiasm of any kind or to
                        indulge in any but the most moderate and placid rejoicing over anything.
                        Good or ill fortune seemed to have no effect whatever upon his spirits or
                        his manner, so far as these who were intimately acquainted with him were
                        able to discover. Perhaps it was only that his philosophy taught him the
                        injustice of asking others to share his sorrows or his rejoicings over
                        events that were indifferent to them.</p>
                    <p>He was always frail in health, but during all the years <pb id="VAA2427-144"
                            n="135"/> of my acquaintance with him I never once heard him mention the
                        fact, or discovered any complaint of it in his tone or manner. At one time
                        his weakness and emaciation were so great that he walked with two crutches,
                        not because of lameness for he had none, but because of sheer physical
                        weakness. Yet even at that time his face was a smiling one and in answer to
                        all inquiries concerning his health he declared himself perfectly well.</p>
                    <p>His self-possessed repression of enthusiasm is clearly manifest in his
                        writings. In none of his stories is there a suggestion of anything but
                        philosophic calm on the part of the man who wrote them. There is humor, a
                        fascinating fancy, and an abounding tenderness of human sympathy of a
                        placidly impersonal character, but there is no passion, no strenuosity,
                        nothing to suggest that the author is anywhere stirred to enthusiasm by the
                        events related or the situations in which his imaginary personages are
                        placed.</p>
                    <p>He one day said to me that he had never regarded what is called "love
                        interest" as necessary to a novel, and in fact he never made any very
                        earnest use of that interest. In "The Late Mrs. Null" he presented the love
                        story with more of amusement than of warmth in his manner, while in "Kate
                        Bonnet" the love affair is scarcely more than a casual adjunct to the pirate
                        story. In "The Hundredth Man" he manifested somewhat greater sympathy, but
                        even there his tone is gently humorous rather than passionate.</p>
                    <p>Many of the whimsical conceits that Stockton afterward made the foundations
                        of his books were first used in the more ephemeral writings of the <hi
                            rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> period. It has often interested me in
                        reading the later books to recall my first acquaintance with their germinal
                        ideas. It has been like meeting interesting men and women whom one remembers
                        as uncouth boys or as girls in pantalettes. For <hi rend="i">Hearth and
                            Home</hi> he wrote several playful articles <pb id="VAA2427-145" n="136"
                        /> about the character of eating houses as revealed in what I may call their
                        physiognomies. The subject seemed to interest and amuse him, as it certainly
                        interested and amused his readers, but at that time he probably did not
                        dream of making it a considerable part of the structure of a novel, as he
                        afterwards did in "The Hundredth Man."</p>
                    <p>In the same way in a series of half serious, half humorous articles for the
                        paper, he wrote of the picturesque features of piracy on the Spanish Main
                        and along our own Atlantic coast. He gave humor to the historical facts by
                        looking at them askancewith an intellectual squint as it wereand attributing
                        to Blackbeard and the rest emotions and sentiments that would not have been
                        out of place in a Sunday School. These things he justified in his humorously
                        solemn way, by challenging anybody to show that the freebooters were not so
                        inspired in fact, and insisting that men's occupations in life constitute no
                        safe index to their characters.</p>
                    <p>"We do not denounce the novelists and story writers," he one day said, "and
                        call them untruthful persons merely because they gain their living by
                        writing things that are not so. In their private lives many of the fiction
                        writers are really estimable persons who go to church, wear clean linen, and
                        pay their debts if they succeed in borrowing money enough for that
                        purpose."</p>
                    <p>Here clearly was the thought that afterward grew into the novel of "Kate
                        Bonnet."</p>
                    <p>About that time he wrote a little manual for Putnam's Handy Book Series, in
                        which he undertook to show how to furnish a home at very small cost. All his
                        readers remember what fun he made of that performance when he came to write
                        "Rudder Grange."</p>
                    <p>I do not think this sort of thing is peculiar to Stockton's work. I find
                        traces of it in the writings of others, especially <pb id="VAA2427-146"
                            n="137"/> of those humorous writers who have the gift of inventing
                        amusingly whimsical conceits. It seems easily possible, for example, to find
                        in "The Bab Ballads" the essential whimsicalities which afterward made the
                        fortunes of Mr. W. S. Gilbert's most famous comic operas.</p>
                    <p>Stockton's whimsical logic was brought to bear upon everything; so much so
                        that I have often wondered how he would have regarded a "hold up" of his
                        person for the sake of his purse if such a thing had happened to him.</p>
                    <p>One day a man submitted a manuscript to me for sale. It was an article on
                        Alice and Phoebe Cary. The subject was interesting and the article was
                        pleasingly brief, so that I thought it promising. When I began to read it,
                        the sentences seemed strangely familiar. As I read on I recognized the thing
                        as an editorial I had myself written for the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi>
                        on the day of Phoebe Cary's funeral. To verify my impression I went at once
                        to the office of the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi>, compared the manuscript
                        with the printed article, and found it to be a verbatim copy.</p>
                    <p>I was perhaps a little severe in my judgments of such things in those days,
                        and when the plagiarist came back to learn the fate of his manuscript my
                        language was of a kind that might have been regarded as severe. After the
                        fellow had left, breathing threats of dire legal things that he meant to do
                        to me for keeping his manuscript without paying for it, Stockton
                        remonstrated with me for having lost my temper.</p>
                    <p>"It seems to me," he said, "that you do not sufficiently consider the
                        circumstances of the case. That man has his living to make as a writer, and
                        nature has denied him the ability to create literature that he can sell.
                        What is more reasonable, then, than that he should select marketable things
                        that other people have written and sell them? His <pb id="VAA2427-147"
                            n="138"/> creative ability failing him, what can he do but use his
                        critical ability in its stead? If he is not equal to the task of producing
                        salable stuff, he at least knows such stuff when he sees it, and in the
                        utilization of that knowledge he finds a means of earning an honest
                        living.</p>
                    <p>"Besides in selecting an article of yours to 'convey,' he has paid you a
                        distinct compliment. He might have taken one of mine instead, but that his
                        critical judgment saw the superiority of yours. You should recognize the
                        tribute he has paid you as a writer.</p>
                    <p>"Still again what harm would have been done if he had succeeded in selling
                        the article? It had completely served its purpose as an editorial in the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post</hi>, why should it not serve a larger purpose and
                        entertain a greater company of readers?</p>
                    <p>"Finally I am impressed with the illustration the case affords of the
                        vagaries of chance as a factor in human happenings. There are thousands of
                        editors in this country to whom that man might have offered the article. You
                        were the only one of them who could by any possibility have recognized it as
                        a plagiarism. According to the doctrine of chances he was perfectly safe in
                        offering the manuscript for sale. The chances were thousands to one against
                        its recognition. It was his ill-luck to encounter the one evil chance in the
                        thousands. The moral of that is that it is unsafe to gamble. Still, now that
                        he knows the one editor who can recognize it, he will no doubt make another
                        copy of the article and sell it in safety to some one else."</p>
                    <p>This prediction was fulfilled. The article appeared not long afterward as a
                        contribution to another periodical. In the meanwhile Stockton's whimsical
                        view of the matter had so amused me as to smooth my temper, and I did not
                        think it necessary to expose the petty theft.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> view taken by Stockton's perverse humor was much the
                        same as that entertained by Benjamin Franklin with greater seriousness. He
                        tells us in his Autobiography that at one time he regularly attended a
                        certain church whose minister preached able sermons that interested him.
                        When it was discovered that the sermons were borrowed, without credit, from
                        some one else, the church dismissed the preacher and put in his place
                        another whose sermons, all his own, did not interest Franklin, who
                        there-upon ceased to attend the church, protesting that he preferred good
                        sermons, plagiarized, to poor ones of the preacher's own.</p>
                    <p>I have since learned what I did not know at the time of the incident related,
                        that there is a considerable company of minor writers hanging as it were on
                        the skirts of literature and journalism, who make the better part of their
                        meager incomes by copying the writings of others and selling them at
                        opportune times. Sometimes these clever pilferers copy matter as they find
                        it, particularly when its source is one not likely to be discovered.
                        Sometimes they make slight alterations in it for the sake of disguise, and
                        sometimes they borrow the substance of what they want and change its form
                        somewhat by rewriting it. Their technical name for this last performance is
                        "skinning" an article.</p>
                    <p>I have since had a good deal of experience with persons of this sort. When
                        Horace Greeley died one of thema womansold me a copy of the text of a very
                        interesting letter from him which she assured me had never been seen by any
                        one outside the little group that cherished the original. I learned later
                        that she had simply copied <pb id="VAA2427-149" n="140"/> the thing from the
                            <hi rend="i">Home Journal</hi>, where it had been printed many months
                        before.</p>
                    <p>One day some years later I had a revelation made to me of the ethics of
                        plagiarism accepted by a certain class of writers for the minor periodicals.
                        I found in an obscure magazine a signed article on the heroism of women, or
                        something of that sort, the first paragraphs of which were copied verbatim
                        from a book of my own, in which I had written it as a personal recollection.
                        When the writer of the article was questioned as to his trespass upon my
                        copyright, he wrote me an exceedingly gracious letter of apology, saying, by
                        way of explanation, that he had found the passage in an old scrapbook of his
                        own, with no memorandum of its authorship attached. He had thought it no
                        harm, he said, to make the thing his own, a thing, he assured me, he would
                        not have done had he known whose the passage was. This explanation seemed to
                        satisfy his conscience completely. I wonder what he would have thought
                        himself privileged to do with a horse or a cow found wandering along a lane
                        without the escort of its owner.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the plagiarist is far more daring in his thefts, taking as his own
                        much greater things and more easily recognized ones than scrapbooks are apt
                        to hold. The boldest thing of the sort with which I ever came into personal
                        contact happened in this wise. As literary editor of the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post</hi> during the late seventies it was a part of my duty to
                        look out for interesting correspondence. One day there came to me a
                        particularly good thing of the kindtwo or three columns of fascinating
                        description of certain phases of life in the Canadian Northwest. The writer
                        proposed to furnish us a series of letters of like kind, dealing with the
                        trading posts of the Hudson Bay Company, life among the trappers, Indians,
                        and half-breeds, and the like. The letter submitted <pb id="VAA2427-150"
                            n="141"/> was so unusually good, both in its substance and in its
                        literary quality, that I agreed to take the series on the terms proposed. A
                        number of the letters followed, and the series attracted the pleased
                        attention of readers. Presently, in addition to his usual letter our
                        correspondent sent us a paper relating to the interesting career of a quaint
                        personage who flourished in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois in their territorial
                        days. He was known as "Johnny Appleseed," because of his habit of carrying a
                        bag of apple seeds in his wanderings and distributing them among the
                        pioneers by way of inducing them to plant orchards.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately that article had been written by some one other than our
                        correspondent and published long before in <hi rend="i">Harper's
                            Magazine.</hi> When my suspicion was thus aroused with regard to the
                        integrity of the correspondent, I instituted an inquiry which revealed the
                        fact that the letters we had so highly valued were plagiarized from a book
                        which had been published in England but not reprinted here.</p>
                    <p>The daring of the man appalled me, but the limit of his assurance had not yet
                        been revealed. When I wrote to him telling him of my discovery of the fraud
                        and declining to send a check for such of the letters as had been printed
                        and not yet paid for, he responded by sending me a number of testimonials to
                        the excellence of his character, furnished by the clergymen, bankers, and
                        leading men generally of the town in which he lived. Having thus
                        rehabilitated his character, he argued that as the letters had proved
                        interesting to the readers of the paper, we had got our money's worth, and
                        that it made no difference in the quality of the literature furnished
                        whether he had written it himself or had transcribed it from a book written
                        by another person. Curiously enough there was a tone of assured sincerity in
                        all this which was baffling to <pb id="VAA2427-151" n="142"/> the
                        understanding. I can explain it only by thinking that he plagiarized that
                        tone also.</p>
                    <p>It was about that time that my work as literary editor of the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post</hi> brought to my attention two cases of what I may call
                        more distinguished plagiarism. Mrs. Wister, a gifted scholar and writer, was
                        at that time rendering a marked service to literature by her exceedingly
                        judicious adaptations of German fiction to the use of American readers. She
                        took German novels that were utterly too long and in other ways unfit for
                        American publication, translated them freely, shortened them, and otherwise
                        saved to American readers all that was attractive in novels which, if
                        directly translated, would have had no acceptability at all in this country.
                        The results were quite as much her own as those of the German authors of the
                        books thus treated.</p>
                    <p>I had recently read and reviewed one of the cleverest of these books of hers,
                        when there came to me for review an English translation of the same German
                        novel, under another title. That translation was presented as the work of an
                        English clergyman, well known as one of the most prolific writers of his
                        time. As I looked over the book I discovered that with the exception of a
                        few initiatory chapters, it was simply a copy of Mrs. Wister's work. In
                        answer to the charge of plagiarism the reverend gentleman explained that he
                        had set out to translate the book, but that when he had rendered a few
                        chapters of it into English Mrs. Wister's work fell into his hands and he
                        found her version so good that he thought it best to adopt it instead of
                        making one of his own. He omitted, however, to explain the ethical
                        conceptions that had restrained him from practising common honesty in a
                        matter involving both reputation and revenue. That was at a time when
                        English complaints of "American piracy" were loudest.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-152" n="143"/>
                    <p>The other case was a more subtle one, and incidentally more interesting to
                        me. As literary editor of the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi>, under the
                        editorship of Mr. Bryant, who held the literary side of the paper's work to
                        be of more consequence than all the rest of it put together, I had to read
                        everything of literary significance that appeared either in England or in
                        America. One day I found in an English magazine an elaborate article which
                        in effect charged Tennyson with wholesale plagiary from Theocritus. The
                        magazinist was disposed to exploit himself as a literary discoverer, and he
                        presented his discoveries with very little of that delicacy and moderation
                        which a considerate critic would regard as the due of so distinguished a
                        poet as Tennyson. I confess that his tone aroused something like antagonism
                        in my mind, and I rather rejoiced when, upon a careful reading of his
                        article, I found that he was no discoverer at all. Practically all that he
                        had to say had been much better said already by Edmund C. Stedman first in a
                        magazine essay and afterwards in a chapter of the "Victorian Poets." The
                        chief difference was that Stedman had written with the impulse and in the
                        tone and manner of a scholarly gentleman, while the other had exploited
                        himself like a prosecuting attorney.</p>
                    <p>The obvious thing to do was to get Stedman, if that were possible, to write a
                        signed article on the subject for the <hi rend="i">Evening Post.</hi> With
                        that end in view I went at once to his office in Broad Street.</p>
                    <p>I knew him well, in literary and social ways, but I had never before
                        trespassed upon his banker existence, and the visit mightily interested me,
                        as one which furnished a view of an unfamiliar side of the "manyest-sided
                        man"that phrase I had learned from Mr. Whitelaw Reidwhom I ever knew.</p>
                    <p>It was during Stock Exchange hours that I made my call, and I intended to
                        remain only long enough to secure <pb id="VAA2427-153" n="144"/> an
                        appointment for some other and less occupied time. But the moment I
                        indicated the matter I wished to consult with him about, Stedman linked his
                        arm in mine and led me to his "den," a little room off the banking offices,
                        and utterly unlike them in every detail. Here were booksnot ledgers; here
                        were all the furnishings of the haunt of a man of letters, without a thing
                        to suggest that the man of letters knew or cared for anything relating to
                        stocks, bonds, securities, loans, discounts, dividends, margins, or any
                        other of the things that are alone considered of any account in Wall
                        Street.</p>
                    <p>"This is the daytime home of the literary side of me," he explained. "When
                        I'm out there"pointing, "I think of financial things; when I enter here I
                        forget what a dollar mark looks like."</p>
                    <p>"I see," I said. "Minerva in Wall StreetAthene, if you prefer the older Greek
                        name."</p>
                    <p>"Say Apollo insteadfor if there is anything I pride myself upon it is my
                        masculinity. 'Male and female created he them, and God saw that it was
                        good,' but the garments of one sex do not become the other, and neither do
                        the qualities and attributes."</p>
                    <p>He had a copy of "The Victorian Poets" in the den and together we made a
                        minute comparison of his study of Tennyson's indebtedness to Theocritus,
                        Bion, and Moschus with the magazinist's article. For result we found that
                        beyond a doubt the magazinist had "skinned" his article out of Stedman's
                        chapterin other words, that he had in effect plagiarized his charge of
                        plagiary and the proofs of it.</p>
                    <p>Stedman refused to write anything on the subject, deeming it not worth while,
                        a judgment which I am bound to say was sound, though I did not like to
                        accept it because my news instinct scented game and I wanted that article
                        from Stedman's pen. His scholarly criticism was literature <pb
                            id="VAA2427-154" n="145"/> of lasting importance and interest. The
                        magazine assault upon Tennyson's fame is utterly forgotten of those who read
                        it.</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>XLII</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was early in our effort to achieve a circulation for
                            <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> that my brother decided to write for
                        it his novel, "The Hoosier Schoolmaster." I have elsewhere related the story
                        of the genesis of that work, and I shall not repeat it here. Its success was
                        immediate and astonishing. It quickly multiplied the circulation of <hi
                            rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> many times over. It was reprinted serially
                        in a dozen or more weekly newspapers in the West and elsewhere, and yet when
                        it was published in a peculiarly unworthy and unattractive book form, its
                        sales exceeded fifty thousand copies during the first month, at a time when
                        the sale of ten thousand copies all told of any novel was deemed an unusual
                        success. The popularity of the story did not end even there. Year after year
                        it continued to sell better than most new novels, and now nearly forty years
                        later, the demand for it amounts to several thousand copies per annum. It
                        was translated into several foreign languagesin spite of the difficulty the
                        translators must have encountered in rendering an uncouth dialect into
                        languages having no such dialect. It was republished in England, and the
                        French version of it appeared in the <hi rend="i">Revue des Deux
                            Mondes.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>But great as its popularity was and still is, I am disposed to regard that as
                        a matter of less significance and less consequence than the influence it
                        exercised in stimulating and guiding the literary endeavors of others. If I
                        may quote a sentence from a book of my own, "The First of the Hoosiers,"
                        Edward Eggleston was "the very first to perceive and utilize in literature
                        the picturesqueness <pb id="VAA2427-155" n="146"/> of the Hoosier life and
                        character, the first to appreciate the poetic and romantic possibilities of
                        that life and to invite others to share with him his enjoyment of its humor
                        and his admiration for its sturdy manliness."</p>
                    <p>While Edward was absorbed in the writing of "The Hoosier Schoolmaster" and
                        its quickly following successor, "The End of the World," he more and more
                        left the editorial conduct of the paper to me, and presently he resigned his
                        editorial place, leaving me as his successor.</p>
                    <p>The work was of a kind that awakened all my enthusiasm. My tastes were
                        literary rather than journalistic, whatever may have been the case as to my
                        capacities, and in the conduct of <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> my work
                        was far more literary in character than any that had fallen to me up to that
                        time in my service on daily newspapers. More important still, it brought me
                        into contact, both personally and by correspondence, with practically all
                        the active literary men and women of that time, with many of whom I formed
                        friendships that have endured to this time in the case of those who still
                        live, and that ended only with the death of those who are gone. The
                        experiences and the associations of that time were both delightful and
                        educative, and I look back upon them after all these years with a joy that
                        few memories can give me. I was a mere apprentice to the literary craft, of
                        course, but I was young enough to enjoy and, I think, not too conceited to
                        feel the need of learning all that such associations could teach.</p>
                    <p>It was during this <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> period that my first
                        books were written and published. They were the results of suggestions from
                        others rather than of my own self-confidence, as indeed most of the
                        thirty-odd books I have written have been.</p>
                    <p>Mr. George P. Putnam, the Nestor of American book publishing, the friend of
                        Washington Irving and the discoverer <pb id="VAA2427-156" n="147"/> of his
                        quality, returned to the work of publishing about that time. In partnership
                        with his son, George Haven Putnam, then a young man and now the head of a
                        great house, he had set up a publishing firm with a meager "list" but with
                        ambition to increase it to a larger one.</p>
                    <p>In that behalf the younger member of the firm planned a series of useful
                        manuals to be called "Putnam's Handy Book Series," and to be sold at
                        seventy-five cents each. With more of hopefulness than of discretion,
                        perhaps, he came to me asking if I could not and would not write one or two
                        of the little volumes. The immediate result was a little book entitled "How
                        to Educate Yourself."</p>
                    <p>In writing it I had the advantage of comparative youth and of that
                        self-confident omniscience which only youth can have. I knew everything then
                        better than I know anything now, so much better indeed that for a score of
                        years past I have not dared open the little book, lest it rebuke my present
                        ignorance beyond my capacity to endure.</p>
                    <p>Crude as the thing was, it was successful, and it seems to have satisfied a
                        genuine need, if I may judge by the numberless letters sent to me by persons
                        who felt that it had helped them. Even now, after the lapse of more than
                        thirty-eight years, such letters come to me occasionally from men in middle
                        life who say they were encouraged and helped by it in their youth. I once
                        thought of rewriting it with more of modesty than I possessed when it had
                        birth, but as that would be to bring to bear upon it a later-acquired
                        consciousness of ignorance rather than an enlarged knowledge of the subject,
                        I refrained, lest the new version should be less helpful than the old.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. Dr. Theodore L. Cuyler once said to me:</p>
                    <p>"If one gets printer's ink on his fingers when he is young, he can never get
                        it off while he lives." The thought <pb id="VAA2427-157" n="148"/> that
                        suggested that utterance had prompt illustration in this case. Not long
                        after this poor little first book was published, I went to Boston to secure
                        literary contributions for <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home.</hi> In those days
                        one had to go to Boston for such things. Literary activity had not yet
                        transferred its dwelling place to New York, nor had Indiana developed its
                        "school."</p>
                    <p>While I was in Boston Mr. Howells called on me, and in his gentle way
                        suggested that I should write my reminiscences of Southern army life in a
                        series of articles for the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly</hi>, of which he
                        was then the editor.</p>
                    <p>The suggestion, coming from such a source, almost made me dizzy. I had
                        vaguely and timidly cherished a secret hope that some dayafter years of
                        preparatory practice in smaller waysI might have the honor and the joy of
                        seeing some article of mine in one or other of the great magazines. But that
                        hope was by no means a confident one, and it looked to a more or less remote
                        future for its fulfilment. Especially it had never been bold enough to
                        include the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly</hi> in the list of its
                        possibilities. That was the magazine of Lowell, Holmes, Whittier,
                        Longfellow, Charles Eliot Norton, and their kindthe mouthpiece of the
                        supremely great in our literature. The thought of ever being numbered among
                        the humblest contributors to that magazine lay far beyond the utmost daring
                        of my dreams. And the supremacy of the <hi rend="i">Atlantic</hi>, in all
                        that related to literary quality, was at that time very real, so that I am
                        in nowise astonished even now that I was well-nigh stunned when Mr. Howells
                        suggested that I should write seven papers for publication there, and
                        afterward embody them in a book together with two others reserved from
                        magazine publication for the sake of giving freshness to the volume.</p>
                    <p>I did not accept the suggestion at once. I was too greatly appalled by it. I
                        had need to go home and cultivate <pb id="VAA2427-158" n="149"/> my
                        self-conceit before I could believe myself capable of writing anything on
                        the high level suggested. In the end I did the thing with great misgiving,
                        but with results that were more than satisfactory, both to Mr. Howells and
                        to me.</p>
                    <p>The passions aroused by the war of which I wrote had scarcely begun to cool
                        at that time and there was a good deal of not very friendly surprise felt
                        when the <hi rend="i">Atlantic's</hi> constituency learned that the great
                        exponent of New England's best thought was to publish the war memories of a
                        Confederate under the seemingly self-assertive title of "A Rebel's
                        Recollections."</p>
                    <p>That feeling seems to have been alert in protest. Soon after the first paper
                        was published Mr. Howells wrote me that it had "brought a hornets' nest
                        about his ears," but that he was determined to go on with the series. After
                        the second paper appeared he wrote me that the hornets had "begun to sing
                        psalms in his ears "because of the spirit and temper in which the sensitive
                        subject was handled. On the evening of the day on which the "Recollections"
                        appeared in book form, there was a banquet at the Parker House in Boston,
                        given in celebration of the <hi rend="i">Atlantic's</hi> fifteenth birthday.
                        Without a moment's warning I was toasted as the author of the latest book
                        from the Riverside Press, and things were said by the toast-master about the
                        spirit in which the book was writtenthings that overwhelmed me with
                        embarrassment, by reason of the fact that it was my first experience of the
                        kind and I was wholly unused to the extravagantly complimentary eloquence of
                        presiding officers at banquets.</p>
                    <p>I had never been made the subject of a toast before. I had never before
                        attempted to make an after-dinner speech, and I was as self-conscious as a
                        schoolboy on the occasion of his first declamation before an outside
                        audience. But one always does stumble through such things. <pb
                            id="VAA2427-159" n="150"/> I have known even an Englishman to stammer
                        out his appreciation and sit down without upsetting more than one or two of
                        his wine glasses. In the same way I uttered some sort of response in spite
                        of the embarrassing fact that George Parsons Lathrop, who had been
                        designated as the "historian of the evening and chronicler of its events,"
                        sat immediately opposite me, manifestly studying me, I thought, as a
                        bugologist might study a new species of beetle. I didn't know Lathrop then,
                        as I afterward learned to know him, in all the friendly warmth and
                        good-fellowship of his nature.</p>
                    <p>When the brief ordeal was over and I sat down in full conviction that I had
                        forever put myself to shame by my oratorical failure, Mr. Howells left his
                        seat and came to say something congratulatorysomething that I attributed to
                        his kindly disposition to help a man up when he is downand when he turned
                        away Mark Twain was there waiting to say something on his own account.</p>
                    <p>"When you were called on to speak," he said, "I braced myself up to come to
                        your rescue and make your speech for you. I thought of half a dozen good
                        things to say, and now they are all left on my hands, and I don't know what
                        on earth to do with them."</p>
                    <p>Then came Mr. Frank B. Sanborn to tell me of a plan he and some others had
                        hurriedly formed to give me a little dinner at Swampscott, at which there
                        should be nobody present but "original abolitionists" and my rebel self.</p>
                    <p>I was unable to accept this attention, but it ended all doubt in my mind that
                        I had written my "Recollections" in a spirit likely to be helpful in the
                        cultivation of good feeling between North and South. The reviews of the
                        book, especially in the New England newspapers, confirmed this conviction,
                        and I had every reason to be satisfied.</p>

                    <p>B<hi rend="sc">EFORE</hi> "A Rebel's Recollections" appeared, I had written
                        and published my first novel, "A Man of Honor."</p>
                    <p>That book, like the others, was the result of accident and not of deliberate
                        purpose. The serial story had become a necessary feature of <hi rend="i"
                            >Hearth and Home</hi>, and we had made a contract with a popular
                        novelist to furnish us with such a story to follow the one that was drawing
                        to a close. Almost at the last moment the novelist failed us, and I
                        hurriedly visited or wrote to all the rest of the available writers in
                        search of a suitable manuscript. There were not so many novelists then as
                        there are now. The search proved futile, and the editorial council was
                        called together in something like panic to consider the alarming situation.
                        The story then running was within a single instalment of its end, and no
                        other was to be had. It was the unanimous opinion of the councilwhich
                        included a member of the publishing firm as its presiding officerthat it
                        would be disastrous to send out a single number of the paper without an
                        instalment of a serial in it, and worse still, if it should contain no
                        announcement of a story to come. The council, in its wisdom, was fully
                        agreed that "something must be done," but no member of it could offer any
                        helpful suggestion as to what that "something" should be. The list of
                        available story writers had been completely exhausted, and it was hopeless
                        to seek further in that direction. Even my old-time friend, John Esten
                        Cooke, whose fertility of fiction was supposed to be limitless, had replied
                        to my earnest entreaties, saying that he was already under contract for two
                        stories, both of which were then in course of serial publication, and
                        neither of which he had finished writing as yet. "Two sets of clamorous
                        printers are <pb id="VAA2427-161" n="152"/> at my heels," he wrote, " and I
                        am less than a week ahead of them in the race between copy and proof
                        slips."</p>
                    <p>As we sat in council, staring at each other in blank despair, I said, without
                        really meaning it:</p>
                    <p>"If worse comes to worst, I'll write the story myself."</p>
                    <p>Instantly the member of the publishing firm who presided over the meeting
                        answered:</p>
                    <p>"That settles the whole matter. Mr. Eggleston will write the story. The
                        council stands adjourned," and without waiting for my remonstrance,
                        everybody hurried out of the room.</p>
                    <p>I had never written a story, long or short. I hadn't the remotest idea what I
                        should or could write about. I had in my mind neither plot nor personages,
                        neither scene nor suggestionnothing whatever out of which to construct a
                        story. And yet the thing must be done, and the printers must have the copy
                        of my first instalment within three days.</p>
                    <p>I turned the key in my desk and fled from the office. I boarded one of the
                        steamers that then ran from Fulton Ferry to Harlem. I wanted to think. I
                        wanted quiettude. When the steamer brought me back, I had in my mind at
                        least a shadowy notionnot of the story as a whole, but of its first chapter,
                        and I had decided upon a title.</p>
                    <p>Hurrying home I set to work to write. About nine o'clock the artist who had
                        been engaged to illustrate the story called upon me and insisted upon it
                        that he must decide at once what he should draw as the first illustration.
                        He reminded me that the drawing must be made on wood, and that it would take
                        two or three days to engrave it after his work upon it should be
                        finished.</p>
                    <p>I pushed toward him the sheets I had written and bade him read them while I
                        went on writing. Before he left <pb id="VAA2427-162" n="153"/> a telegram
                        came from the office asking what the title of the story was to be, in order
                        that the paper, going to press that night, might carry with it a flaming
                        announcement of its beginning in the next number.</p>
                    <p>From beginning to end the story was written in that hurried way, each
                        instalment going into type before the next was written. Meanwhile, I had the
                        editorial conduct of the paper to look after and the greater part of the
                        editorial page to write each week.</p>
                    <p>The necessary result was a crude, ill-considered piece of work, amateurish in
                        parts, and wholly lacking in finish throughout. Yet it proved acceptable as
                        a serial, and when it came out in book form ten thousand copies were sold on
                        advance orders. The publishers were satisfied; the public seemed satisfied,
                        and as for the author, he had no choice but to rest content with results for
                        which he could in no way account then, and cannot account now.</p>
                    <p>The nearest approach to an explanation I have ever been able to imagine is
                        that the title" A Man of Honor"was a happy one. Of that there were many
                        proofs then and afterwards. The story had been scarcely more than begun as a
                        serial, when Edgar Fawcett brought out a two or three number story with the
                        same title, in <hi rend="i">Apple-tons' Journal</hi>, I think. Then Dion
                        Bcucicault cribbed the title, attached it to a play he had "borrowed" from
                        some French dramatist, and presented the whole as his own.</p>
                    <p>Finally, about a dozen years later, a curious thing happened. I was acting at
                        the time as a literary adviser of Harper &amp; Brothers. There was no
                        international copyright law then, but when a publisher bought advance sheets
                        of an English book and published it here simultaneously or nearly so with
                        its issue in England, a certain courtesy of the trade forbade other
                        reputable publishing houses to trespass. The Harpers kept two agents in
                        London, one of them to send over advance sheets for <pb id="VAA2427-163"
                            n="154"/> purchase, and the other to send books as they were
                        published.</p>
                    <p>One day among the advance sheets sent to me for judgment I found a novel by
                        Mrs. Stannard, the lady who wrote under the pen name of John Strange Winter.
                        It was a rather interesting piece of work, but it bore my title, "A Man of
                        Honor." In advising its purchase I entered my protest against the use of
                        that title in the proposed American edition. Of course the protest had no
                        legal force, as our American copyright law affords no protection to titles,
                        but with an honorable house like the Harpers the moral aspect of the matter
                        was sufficient.</p>
                    <p>The situation was a perplexing one. The Harpers had in effect already bought
                        the story from Mrs. Stannard for American publication. They must publish
                        simultaneously with the English appearance of the novel or lose all claim to
                        the protection of the trade courtesy. There was not time enough before
                        publication day for them to communicate with the author and secure a change
                        of title.</p>
                    <p>In this perplexity Mr. Joseph W. Harper, then the head of the house and a
                        personal friend of my own, asked me if I would consent to the use of the
                        title if he should print a footnote on the first page of the book, setting
                        forth the fact of my prior claim to it and saying that the firm was indebted
                        to my courtesy for the privilege of using it.</p>
                    <p>I readily consented to this and the book appeared in that way. A little
                        later, in a letter, Mrs. Stannard sent me some pleasant messages, saying
                        especially that she had found among her compatriots no such courteous
                        reasonableness in matters of the kind as I had shown. By way of illustration
                        she said that some years before, when she published "Houp-la," she had been
                        compelled to pay heavy damages to an obscure writer who had previously <pb
                            id="VAA2427-164" n="155"/> used the title in some insignificant
                        provincial publication, never widely known and long ago forgotten.</p>
                    <p>In the case of "A Man of Honor" the end was not yet. Mrs. Stannard's novel
                        with that title and the footnote was still in its early months of American
                        circulation when one day I found among the recently published English novels
                        sent to me for examination one by John Strange Winter (Mrs. Stannard)
                        entitled, "On March." Upon examining it I found it to be the same that the
                        Harpers had issued with the "Man of Honor" title. I suppose that after the
                        correspondence above referred to, Mrs. Stannard had decided to give the
                        English edition of her work this new title, but had omitted to notify the
                        Harpers of the change.</p>
                    <p>Mention of this matter of trouble with titles reminds me of a rather curious
                        case which amused me at the time of its occurrence and may amuse the reader.
                        In the year 1903 I published a novel entitled "The Master of Warlock."
                        During the summer of that year I one day received a registered letter from a
                        man named Warlock, who wrote from somewhere in Brooklyn. The missive was
                        brief and peremptory. Its writer ordered me to withdraw the book from
                        circulation instantly, and warned me that no more copies of it were to be
                        sold. He offered no reason for his commands and suggested no explanation of
                        his authority to give them. I wrote asking him upon what ground he assumed
                        to interfere, and for reply he said briefly: "My grounds are personal and
                        legal." Beyond that he did not explain.</p>
                    <p>He had written in the same way to the publishers of the book, who answered
                        him precisely as I had done.</p>
                    <p>A month later there came another registered letter from him. In it he said
                        that a month had passed since his demand was made and that as I had paid no
                        heed to it, he now repeated it. He said he was armed with adequate <pb
                            id="VAA2427-165" n="156"/> proof that many copies of the book had been
                        sold during that montha statement which I am glad to say was true. There
                        must now be a prompt and complete withdrawal of the novel from the market,
                        he said.</p>
                    <p>This time the peremptory gentleman graciously gave me at least a hint of the
                        ground upon which he claimed a right to order the suppression of the novel.
                        He said I ought to know that I had no right to make use of any man's surname
                        in fiction, especially when it was a unique name like his own.</p>
                    <p>As I was passing the summer at my Lake George cottage, I sent him a note
                        saying that I should continue in my course, and giving him the address of a
                        lawyer in New York who would accept service for me in any action he might
                        bring.</p>
                    <p>For a time thereafter I waited anxiously for the institution of his suit. I
                        foresaw a great demand for the book as a consequence of it, and I planned to
                        aid in that. I arranged with some of my newspaper friends in New York to
                        send their cleverest reporters to write of the trial. Charles Henry Webb"
                        John Paul," who wrote the burlesques, "St. Twelvemo" and "Liffith
                        Lank"proposed to take up on his own account Mr. Warlock's contention that
                        the novelist has no right to use any man's surname in a novel, and make
                        breezy fun of it by writing a novelette upon those lines. In his preface he
                        purposed to set forth the fact that there is scarcely any conceivable name
                        that is not to be found in the New York City directory, and that even a name
                        omitted from that widely comprehensive work, was pretty sure to belong to
                        somebody somewhere, so that under the Warlock doctrine its use must involve
                        danger. He would show that the novelist must therefore designate his
                        personages as "Thomas Ex Square," "Tabitha Twenty Three," and so on with a
                        long list of mathematical impersonalities. Then he <pb id="VAA2427-166"
                            n="157"/> planned to give a sample novel written in that way, in which
                        the dashing young cavalier, Charles Augustus + should make his passionate
                        addresses to the fascinating Lydia =, only to learn from her tremulous lips
                        that she was already betrothed to the French nobleman, Compte <unclear/>
                        <hi rend="sup">3</hi>y.</p>
                    <p>Unhappily Mr. Warlock never instituted his suit; John Paul lost an
                        opportunity, and the public lost a lot of fun.</p>
                    <p>By way of completing the story of this absurdity, it is worth while to record
                        that the novel complained of had no personage in it bearing the name of
                        Warlock. In the book that name was merely the designation by which a certain
                        Virginia plantation was known.</p>

                    <p>D<hi rend="sc">URING</hi> our early struggles to secure a place for <hi
                            rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> in popular favor, I was seized with a
                        peculiarly vaulting ambition. John Hay's "Pike County Ballads" were under
                        discussion everywhere. Phrases from them were the current coin of
                        conversation. Critics were curiously studying them as a new and effective
                        form of literature, and many pious souls were in grave alarm over what they
                        regarded as blasphemy in Mr. Hay's work, especially the phrase "a durned
                        sight better business than loafin' round the throne," at the end of "Little
                        Breeches."</p>
                    <p>I knew Mr. Hay slightly. Having ceased for a time to hold diplomatic place,
                        he was a working writer then, with his pen as his one source of income. I
                        made up my mind to secure a Pike County Ballad for <hi rend="i">Hearth and
                            Home</hi> even though the cost of it should cause our publishers the
                        loss of some sleep. Knowing that his market was a good one for anything he
                        might choose to write, <pb id="VAA2427-167" n="158"/> I went to him with an
                        offer such as few writers, if any at that time, had ever received, thinking
                        to outbid all others who might have designs upon his genius.</p>
                    <p>It was of no use. He said that the price offered "fairly took his breath
                        away," but told me with the emphasis of serious assurance, that he "could
                        not write a Pike County Ballad to save his life." "That was what they call a
                        'pocket mine,'" he added, "and it is completely worked out."</p>
                    <p>He went on to tell me the story of the Ballads and the circumstances in which
                        they were written. As he told me the same thing more in detail many years
                        later, adding to it a good many little reminiscences, I shall draw upon the
                        later rather than the earlier memory in writing of the matter here.</p>
                    <p>It was in April, 1902, when he was at the height of his brilliant career as
                        Secretary of State that I visited him by invitation. In the course of a
                        conversation I reminded him of what he had told me about thirty years
                        before, concerning the genesis of the ballads, and said:</p>
                    <p>"I wonder if you would let me print that story? It seems to me something the
                        public is entitled to share."</p>
                    <p>He responded without hesitation:</p>
                    <p>"Certainly. Print it by all means if you wish, and in order that you may get
                        it right after all these years, I'll tell it to you again. It came about in
                        this way: I was staying for a time at a hospitable country house, and on a
                        hot summer Sunday I went with the rest to church where I sleepily listened
                        to a sermon. In the course of it the good old parsonwho hadn't a trace of
                        humorous perception in his make-up, droned out a story substantially the
                        same as that in 'Little Breeches.'</p>
                    <p>"As I sat there in the sleepy sultriness of the summer Sunday, in an
                        atmosphere that seemed redolent of roasting pine pews and scorching cushion
                        covers, I fell to thinking <pb id="VAA2427-168" n="159"/> of Pike County
                        methods of thought, of what humor a Pike County dialect telling of that
                        story would have, and of what impression the story itself, as solemnly
                        related by the preacher, would make upon the Pike County mind. There are two
                        Pike Counties, you knowone in Illinois and the other confronting it across
                        the river, in Missouri. But the people of the two Pike Counties are very
                        much alikeisomeric, as the chemists sayand they have a dialect speech, a
                        point of view, and an intellectual attitude in common, and all their own. I
                        have encountered nothing else like it anywhere.</p>
                    <p>"When I left the church that Sunday, I was full to the lips of an imaginary
                        Pike County version of the preacher's story, and on the train as I journeyed
                        to New York, I entertained myself by writing 'Little Breeches.' The thing
                        was done merely for my own amucement, without the smallest thought of print.
                        But when I showed it to Whitelaw Reid he seized upon the manuscript and
                        published it in the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>.</p>
                    <p>"By that time the lilt and swing of the Pike County Ballad had taken
                        possession of me. I was filled with the Pike County spirit, as it were, and
                        the humorous side of my mind was entertained by its rich possibilities.
                        Within a week after the appearance of 'Little Breeches' in print all the
                        Pike County Ballads were written. After that the impulse was completely gone
                        from me. There was absolutely no possibility of another thing of the kind.
                        When you asked me for something of that kind for <hi rend="i">Hearth and
                            Home</hi>, I told you truly that I simply could not produce it. There
                        were no more Pike County Ballads in me, and there never have been any
                        since.</p>
                    <p>"Let me tell you a queer thing about that. From the hour when the last of the
                        ballads was written until now, I have never been able to feel that they were
                        mine, that my mind had had anything to do with their creation, <pb
                            id="VAA2427-169" n="160"/> or that they bore any trace of kinship to my
                        thought or my intellectual impulses. They seem utterly foreign to meas
                        foreign as if I had first encountered them in print, as the work of somebody
                        else. It is a strange feeling. Of course every creative writer feels
                        something of the sort with regard to much of his work, but I, at least, have
                        never had the feeling one-tenth so strongly with regard to anything else I
                        ever did.</p>
                    <p>"Now, let me tell you," Mr. Hay continued, "of some rather interesting
                        experiences I have had with respect to the ballads. One day at the Gilsey
                        House, in New York, I received the card of a gentleman, and when he came to
                        my room he said:</p>
                    <p>"'I am the son of the man whom you celebrated in one of your ballads as Jim
                        Bludso, the engineer who stuck to his duty and declared he would" hold her
                        nozzle agin the bank till the last galoot's ashore."'"</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hay added:</p>
                    <p>"This gave me an opportunity. Mark Twain had criticised the ballad, saying
                        that Jim Bludso must have been a pilot, and not an engineer, for the reason
                        that an engineer, having once set his engines going, could have no need to
                        stay by them. In view of this criticism, I asked my visitor concerning it,
                        telling him of what Mark Twain had said. For answer the caller assured me
                        that the original Jim Bludso was in fact an engineer. He explained that as a
                        Mississippi River steamboat has two engines, each turning an independent
                        wheel, and as the current of the river is enormously swift, it was necessary
                        for the engineer to remain at his post, working one engine and then the
                        other, backing on one sometimes and going ahead on the other, if her nozzle
                        was to be held 'agin the bank till the last galoot's ashore.'"</p>
                    <p>For reply to this I told Mr. Hay that I had seen in a Memphis cemetery a
                        tombstone erected to a pilot, and <pb id="VAA2427-170" n="161"/> inscribed
                        with the story of his heroic death in precisely Jim Bludso's spirit. At the
                        time that I read the inscription on it, "Jim Bludso" had not been written,
                        but the matter interested me and I made inquiry for the exact facts. The
                        story as I heard it was this: The boat being afire the pilot landed her,
                        head-on against a bank that offered no facilities for making her fast with
                        cables. The only way to get the "galoots ashore" was for the pilot to remain
                        at his post and ring his engine bells for going ahead and backing, so as to
                        "hold her nozzle agin the bank." But the flames were by that time licking
                        the rear of the pilot house, and the captain frantically entreated the pilot
                        to leap from the forward part of the structure to the deck below. This the
                        heroic fellow refused to do so long as the safety of the passengers required
                        his presence at his post. He stood there, calmly smoking his cigar and
                        coolly ringing his bells as occasion required till at last every other human
                        being on board had been saved. By that time the flames had completely
                        enveloped the pilot-house, and there was left no possible way of escape.
                        Then relinquishing his hold upon the wheel, the pilot folded his arms and
                        stood like a statue until the floor beneath him gave way and he sank to a
                        cruel death in the furnace-like fire below.</p>
                    <p>The details of the story were related to me by Captain John Cannon, of the
                        steamer "Robert E. Lee," and the weather-beaten old navigator was not
                        ashamed of the tears that trickled down his cheeks as he told the tale.</p>
                    <p>When I had finished, Mr. Hay said:</p>
                    <p>"That only means that we have two heroes to revere instead of one. Jim Bludso
                        was an engineer."</p>
                    <p>Continuing his talk of coincidences, Mr. Hay said:</p>
                    <p>"I once went up to my native village, and as I walked along the street I
                        accidentally jostled a man. When I apologized, he turned to me and said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-171" n="162"/>
                    <p>"'I ought to know you and you ought to know me, for your name's John Hay and
                        mine's Jim Bludso. But I'm not the fellow you wrote that poetry about. He's
                        very dead and you see I'm very much alive.'"</p>
                    <p>Then Mr. Hay told me of another curious encounter that connected itself with
                        the Pike County Ballads.</p>
                    <p>"You remember," he said, "that it was from the sermon of an old minister that
                        I got the story told in 'Little Breeches.' Well, when I was in California in
                        company with President McKinley, I was one day visited by a venerable man
                        who proved to be none other than the preacher from whose lips I had heard
                        the original and authoritative prosaic version of that miracle story. It is
                        curious how these coincidences occur."</p>
                    <p>The substance of this conversation with Mr. Hay was embodied in an article of
                        mine in the New York <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> for April 27, 1902. Proofs of
                        the interview were sent to Mr. Hay in advance of publication, with my
                        request that he should make such corrections in them as he saw fit. He
                        returned the slips to me without an alteration and with a note saying: "I
                        have no suggestions to make. Your report of our conversation is altogether
                        accurate. I only wish I might have said something better worth
                        printing."</p>
                    <p>That was the last time I saw John Hay. It was the end of an acquaintance
                        which had been cordial, though not intimate, and which had extended over a
                        period of thirty years. As I was leaving he stopped me. He took up a copy of
                        the pamphlet containing his splendid tribute to the memory of President
                        McKinley, inscribed it with his autograph, and handed it to me, saying, with
                        a touch of sadness which was not quite melancholy:</p>
                    <p>"You care for my literary work. Perhaps in the coming years you will care to
                        have, from my own hand, this <pb id="VAA2427-172" n="163"/> copy of my
                        latest and probably my last essay in that department of human endeavor."</p>
                    <p>The event verified his prophecy. He soon afterward fell ill, and in the year
                        1905 he died, affectionately regretted by every one who had ever known him
                        personally and by scores of thousands who had known him only through his
                        work.</p>
                    <p>John Hay's personal character was the foundation upon which all his
                        successes, whether in journalism, literature, or statecraft were built. He
                        was utterly sincere, as instinctively truthful as a child, and as gentle of
                        spirit as any woman ever was. Those who knew him personally were never at a
                        loss to account for the ease with which, in diplomatic matters, he won men
                        to his wish and persuaded them to his point of view. Every one who came into
                        contact with him was constrained by his gentle reasonableness to agree with
                        him. His whole nature was winning in an extraordinary degree. Strong as he
                        was in his own convictions, his assertion of them never took the form of
                        antagonism. I really suppose that John Hay never said a thing in his life
                        which aroused resentmentand that not because of any hesitation on his part
                        to utter his thought but because of the transparent justice of the thought,
                        and of his gently persuasive way of uttering it. His convictions were strong
                        and there was enough of apostleship in his nature to prompt him to urge them
                        on all proper occasions; but he urged them soothingly, convincingly, never
                        by arrogant assertion or with obnoxious insistence.</p>
                    <p>Feeling no disposition to quarrel with anybody on his own account, he was
                        always alert to make an end of other people's quarrels when opportunity of
                        pacification came to him.</p>
                    <p>I remember an instance of this that fell under my own notice. During a
                        prolonged absence of Mr. Whitelaw <pb id="VAA2427-173" n="164"/> Reid from
                        the country, Mr. Hay was left in control of the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>. I
                        was not connected with any newspaper at the time, but was "running a
                        literary shop" of my own, as Mr. Hay expressed itwriting books of my own,
                        editing other people's books, advising a publishing firm, and writing for
                        various newspapers and magazines. Now and then, when some occurrence
                        suggested it, I wrote an editorial article for the <hi rend="i"
                        >Tribune</hi>, as I had done occasionally for a good many years before.</p>
                    <p>One day Mr. Hay asked me to call upon him with reference to some work he
                        wanted me to do. After we had arranged all the rest of it, he picked up
                        Jefferson Davis's "Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government," which had
                        just been published.</p>
                    <p>"That is a subject," Mr. Hay said, "on which you can write as an expert. I
                        want you, if you will, to review the book for the <hi rend="i"
                        >Tribune</hi>."</p>
                    <p>I objected that my estimate of Mr. Davis was by no means a flattering one,
                        and that in a cursory examination which I had already given to his book, I
                        had discovered some misrepresentations of fact so extraordinary that they
                        could not be passed over in charitable silence. I cited, as one of these
                        misrepresentations, Mr. Davis's minute accountexpunged from later editions
                        of the book, I believeof the final evacuation of Fort Sumter and the city of
                        Charlestonin which he gave an account of certain theatrical performances
                        that never occurred, and of impassioned speeches made by an officer who was
                        not there and had not been there for eight months before the time of the
                        evacuation.</p>
                    <p>"So far as that is concerned," said Mr. Hay, "it makes no difference. As a
                        reviewer you will know what to say of such things. Mr. Davis has put forward
                        a book. It is subject to criticism at the hands of any capable and honest
                        reviewer. Write of it conscientiously, and <pb id="VAA2427-174" n="165"/>
                        with as much of good temper as you can. That is all I desire."</p>
                    <p>I then suggested another difficulty. For a considerable time past there had
                        been some ill feeling between the editor of the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>
                        and the publishers of Mr. Davis's book. The <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> did
                        not review or in any way mention books published by that firm. On one
                        occasion, when I had been asked to review a number of books for the paper,
                        one of them was withdrawn on that account. I suggested to Mr. Hay that
                        perhaps a review of Mr. Davis's book by one who had been thus warned of the
                        situation might be a displeasing impertinence. He replied:</p>
                    <p>"I have had no instructions on that head. I know nothing about the ill
                        feeling. Perhaps you and I may make an end of the trouble by ignoring it.
                        Write your review and I will publish it."</p>
                    <p>One other thing I may mention here as perhaps of interest. When the anonymous
                        novel, "The Breadwinners," appeared, it excited a good deal of comment
                        because of the freedom with which the author presented prominent persons
                        under a disguise too thin to conceal identity. The novel was commonly and
                        confidently attributed to Mr. Hay, and some of the critics ventured to
                        censure him for certain features of it. One night at the Authors Club, at a
                        time when talk of the matter was in everybody's mouth, and when Mr. Hay's
                        authorship of the work had well-high ceased to be in doubt, he and I were
                        talking of other things, when suddenly he said to me:</p>
                    <p>"I suppose you share the general conviction with regard to the authorship of
                        'The Breadwinners.' Let me tell you that I did not write that book, though I
                        confess that some things in it seem to justify the popular belief that I
                        did."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-175" n="166"/>
                    <p>The peculiar form of words in which he couched his denial left me in doubt as
                        to its exact significance, and to this day that doubt has never been
                        resolved. Of course I could not subject him to a cross-examination on the
                        subject.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>XLV</head>
                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">HAVE</hi> wandered somewhat from the chronology of my
                        recollections, but this record is not a statistical table, and so it matters
                        not if I wander farther still in pursuit of vagrant memories.</p>
                    <p>The mention of Mr. Hay's old preacher who had no sense of humor in his
                        composition reminds me of another of like kind, who was seized with an
                        ardent desire to contributefor compensationa series of instructive moral
                        essays to <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi>.</p>
                    <p>When asked by a member of the publishing firm to let him do so, I replied
                        that I did not think the paper was just then in pressing need of instructive
                        moral essays, but that the reverend gentlemen might send one as a sample. He
                        sent it. It began thus:</p>
                    <p>"Some philosopher has wisely observed that 'every ugly young woman has the
                        comforting assurance that she will be a pretty old woman if she lives long
                        enough.' Doubtless the philosopher meant that a young woman destitute of
                        physical beauty, with all its temptations, is sure to cultivate those
                        spiritual qualities which give beauty and more than beauty to the
                        countenance in later years."</p>
                    <p>And so the dear, innocent old gentleman went on for a column or so, utterly
                        oblivious of the joke he had accepted as profound philosophy. I had half a
                        mind to print his solemn paper in the humorous column entitled, "That
                        Reminds Me," but, in deference to his age and dignity, I forbore. As is
                        often the case in such matters, <pb id="VAA2427-176" n="167"/> my
                        forbearance awakened no gratitude in him. In answer to his earnest request
                        to know why I thought his essay unworthy, I was foolish enough to point out
                        and explain the jocular character of his "philosopher's" utterance,
                        whereupon he wrote to my publishers, strongly urging them to employ a new
                        editor, for that "the young man you now have is obviously a person of
                        frivolous mind who sees only jests in utterances of the most solemn and
                        instructive import."</p>
                    <p>As the publishers did not ask for my resignation, I found it easy to forgive
                        my adversary.</p>
                    <p>In view of the multitude of cases in which the writers of rejected
                        contributions and the victims of adverse criticism are at pains to advise
                        publishers to change their editors, I have sometimes wondered that the
                        editorial fraternity is not continually a company of literary nomads,
                        looking for employment. In one case, I remember, a distinguished critic
                        reviewing a rather pretentious book, pointed out the fact that the author
                        had confounded rare old Ben Jonson with Dr. Samuel Johnson in a way likely
                        to be misleading to careless or imperfectly informed readers, whereupon not
                        only the author but all his friends sent letters clamoring for the dismissal
                        of a reviewer so lacking in sympathetic appreciation of sincere literary
                        endeavor. When I told Mr. George Ripley of the matter he replied:</p>
                    <p>"Oh, that is the usual thing. I am keeping a collection of letters sent to
                        Mr. Greeley demanding my discharge. I think of bequeathing it to the Astor
                        Library as historical material, reflecting the literary conditions of our
                        time."</p>
                    <p>In one case of the kind that fell to my share there was a rather dramatic
                        outcome. I was acting as a literary adviser for Harper &amp; Brothers,
                        when there came to me for judgment the manuscript of a novel in which I <pb
                            id="VAA2427-177" n="168"/> found more of virility and strong human
                        interest than most novels possess, together with a well constructed plot, a
                        pleasing literary style, and some unusually well conceived and well
                        portrayed characters. The work was so good indeed that it was with very
                        sincere regret that I found myself obliged to condemn it. I had to do so
                        because it included, as an inseparable part of its structure, a severe and
                        even a bitter assault upon the work and the methods of Mr. Moody and all the
                        other "irregular troops" in the army of religion, not sparing even the
                        "revival" methods of the Methodists and Baptists. It was a rigid rule of the
                        Harpers not to publish books of that kind, and I might with propriety have
                        reported simply that the novel included matters which rendered it
                        unavailable for the Harper list. But I was so interested in it and so
                        impressed with its superior quality as a work of fiction that instead of a
                        brief recommendation of rejection, I sent in an elaborate critical analysis
                        of it, including a pretty full synopsis of its plot. The "opinion" filled
                        many pages of manuscriptmore than I had ever before written in that way
                        concerning any book submitted to me.</p>
                    <p>A week or so later I happened to call at the Harper establishment, as it was
                        my custom to do occasionally. Seeing me, Mr. Joseph W. Harper, Jr."Brooklyn
                        Joe" we called himbeckoned to me, and, with a labored assumption of
                        solemnity which a mirthful twinkle in his eye completely spoiled, said:</p>
                    <p>"I have a matter which I must bring to your attention, greatly to my regret.
                        Read that."</p>
                    <p>With that he handed me a letter from the author of the novel, an Episcopalian
                        clergyman of some distinction.</p>
                    <p>The writer explained that his vanity was in no way offended by the rejection
                        of his work. That, he said, was to be expected in the case of an unknown
                        author (a flattering <pb id="VAA2427-178" n="169"/> unction with which
                        unsuccessful authorship always consoles itself), but that he felt it to be
                        his duty as a clergyman, a moralist, and a good citizen, to report to the
                        house that their reader was robbing them to the extent of his salary. He had
                        incontrovertible proof, he said, that the reader had not read a single page
                        or line of his manuscript before rejecting it.</p>
                    <p>"There," said Joe Harper when I had finished the letter. "I really didn't
                        think you that sort of a person."</p>
                    <p>"What did you say to him by way of reply?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"I'll show you," he said, taking up his letter-book. "I inclosed a copy of
                        that intolerably long opinion of yours and wrote this." Then he let me read
                        the letter. In it he thanked the gentleman for having brought the
                        dereliction of the reader to the attention of the house, but suggested that
                        before proceeding to extreme measures in such a case, he thought it well to
                        be perfectly sure of the facts. To that end, he wrote, he inclosed an exact
                        copy of the "opinion" on which the novel had been declined, and asked the
                        author to read it and report whether or not he still felt certain that the
                        writer of the opinion had condemned the work unread.</p>
                    <p>The entire letter was written in a tone of submissive acceptance of the
                        rejected author's judgment in the case. As a whole it seemed to me as
                        withering a piece of sarcasm as I ever read, and in spite of the injustice
                        he had sought to do me, I was distinctly sorry for the man to whom it was
                        addressed. I suppose Mr. Harper felt in the same way, but all that he said,
                        as he put the letter-book upon his desk, was:</p>
                    <p>"I hope he prepares his sermon early in the week, for that letter of mine
                        must have reached him about Friday morning, and it may have created a
                        greater or less disturbance in his mind."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-179" n="170"/>
                    <p>A few days later there came a reply. The author said that an examination of
                        the "opinion" left no room for doubt that the work had been read with care
                        throughout, but that he had confidently believed otherwise when he wrote his
                        first letter. He explained that before sending the manuscript he had tied a
                        peculiar cord around it, inside the wrapper, and that when it came back to
                        him with the same cord tied about it, he thought it certain that the package
                        had never been opened. He was sorry he had made a mistake, of course, but he
                        had been entirely sincere, etc., etc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harper indulged himself in an answer to all this. If I had not been
                        permitted to read it, I should never have believed that anything so caustic
                        could have been uttered by a man so genially good-tempered as I knew Mr.
                        Harper to be. It was all the more effective because from beginning to end
                        there was no trace of excitement, no touch of anger, no word or phrase in it
                        that could be criticised as harsh or intemperate.</p>
                    <p>Beneath the complaint made by the clerical author in that case there was a
                        mistaken assumption with which every publisher and every editor is
                        familiarthe assumption, namely, that the publisher or editor to whom
                        unsolicited manuscripts are sent is under some sort of moral obligation to
                        read them or have them read. Of course no such obligation exists. When the
                        publisher or editor is satisfied that he does not wish to purchase a
                        manuscript, it makes no manner of difference by what process he has arrived
                        at that conclusion. The subject of the book or article may be one that he
                        does not care to handle; the author's manner, as revealed in the early pages
                        of his manuscript, may justify rejection without further reading. Any one of
                        a score of reasons may be conclusive without the necessity of examining the
                        manuscript in whole or even in part. I once advised the rejection of a book
                        without <pb id="VAA2427-180" n="171"/> reading it, on the ground that the
                        woman who wrote it used a cambric needle and milk instead of a pen and ink,
                        so that it would be a gross immorality to put her manuscript into the hands
                        of printers whose earnings depended upon the number of ems they could set in
                        a day.</p>
                    <p>But the conviction is general among the amateur authors of unsolicited
                        manuscripts that the editors or publishers to whom they send their literary
                        wares are morally bound not only to examine them, but to read them carefully
                        from beginning to end. They sometimes resort to ingenious devices by way of
                        detecting the rascally editors in neglect of this duty. They slenderly stick
                        the corners of two sheets together; or they turn up the lower corner of a
                        sheet here and there as if by accident but so carefully as to cover a word
                        or two from sight; or they place a sheet upside down, or in some other way
                        set a trap that makes the editor smile if he happens to be in good temper,
                        and causes him to reject the thing in resentment of the impertinence if his
                        breakfast has not agreed with him that day.</p>
                    <p>I was speaking of these things one day, to Mr. George P. Putnam, Irving's
                        friend and the most sympathetically literary of publishers then living, when
                        he suddenly asked me:</p>
                    <p>"Do you know the minimum value of a lost manuscript?"</p>
                    <p>I professed ignorance, whereupon he said:</p>
                    <p>"It is five hundred dollars." Presently, in answer to a question, he
                        explained:</p>
                    <p>"In the old days of <hi rend="i">Putnam's Monthly</hi>, one of the multitude
                        of unsolicited manuscripts sent in would now and then be mislaid. I never
                        knew a case of the kind in which the author failed to value the manuscript
                        at five hundred dollars or more, no matter what its subject or its length or
                        even its worthlessness might be. In one <pb id="VAA2427-181" n="172"/> case,
                        when I refused to pay the price fixed upon by the author, he instituted
                        suit, and very earnestly protested that his manuscript was worth far more
                        than the five hundred dollars demanded for it. He even wrote me that he had
                        a definite offer of more than that sum for it. To his discomfiture somebody
                        in the office found the manuscript about that time and we returned it to the
                        author. He sent it back, asking us to accept it. I declined. He then offered
                        it for two hundred and fifty dollars, then for two hundred, and finally for
                        seventy-five. I wrote to him that he needn't trouble to reduce his price
                        further, as the editors did not care to accept the paper at any price. I
                        have often wondered why he didn't sell it to the person who, as he asserted,
                        had offered him more than five hundred dollars for it; but he never did, as
                        the thing has never yet been published, and that was many years ago."</p>

                        them was the newest of celebrities in American literature; the other was old
                        enough to have been lampooned by Poe in his series of papers called "The

                    <p>The one was Joaquin Miller, the other Thomas Dunn English.</p>
                    <p>Joaquin Miller had recently returned in a blaze of glory from his conquest of
                        London society and British literary recognition. He brought me a note of
                        introduction from Mr. Richard Watson Gilder of the <hi rend="i">Century</hi>
                        or <hi rend="i">Scribner's Monthly</hi> as I think the magazine was still
                        called at that time. He wore a broad-brimmed hat of most picturesque type.
                        His trousersLondon made and obviously <pb id="VAA2427-182" n="173"/>
                        costlywere tucked into the most superior looking pair of high top boots I
                        ever saw, and in his general make-up he was an interesting cross or
                        combination of the "untutored child of nature" fresh from the plains, and
                        the tailor-made man of fashion. More accurately, he seemed a carefully
                        costumed stage representation of the wild Westerner that he professed to be
                        in fact. I do not know that all this, or any of it, was affectation in the
                        invidious sense of the term. I took it to be nothing more than a clever bit
                        of advertising. He was a genuine poetas who can doubt who has read him? He
                        had sagacity and a keen perception both of the weakness and the strength of
                        human nature. He wanted a hearing, and he knew the shortest, simplest,
                        surest way to get it. Instead of publishing his poems and leaving it to his
                        publisher to bring them to attention by the slow processes of newspaper
                        advertising, he went to London, and made himself his own advertisement by
                        adopting a picturesque pose, which was not altogether a pose, though it was
                        altogether picturesque, and trusting the poems, to which he thus directed
                        attention, to win favor for themselves.</p>
                    <p>In saying that his assumption of the rle of untutored child of nature was not
                        altogether an assumption, I mean that although his boyhood was passed in
                        Indiana schools, and he was for a time a college student there, he had
                        nevertheless passed the greater part of his young manhood in the wilds and
                        among the men of the wilderness. If he was not in fact "untutored," he
                        nevertheless owed very little to the schools, and scarcely anything to the
                        systematic study of literature. His work was marked by crudenesses that were
                        not assumed or in any wise fictitious, while the genuineness of poetic
                        feeling and poetic perception that inspired it was unquestionably the
                        spontaneous product of his own soul and mind.</p>
                    <p>In my editorial den he seated himself on my desk, <pb id="VAA2427-183"
                            n="174"/> though there was a comfortable chair at hand. Was that a bit
                        of theatrical "business"? I think not, for the reason that Thomas Bailey
                        Aldrich, the least affected of men, used nearly always to bestride a
                        reversed chair with his hands resting upon its back, when he visited me in
                        my office, as he sometimes did, to smoke a pipe in peace for half an hour
                        and entertain me with his surprising way of "putting things," before "going
                        off to suffer and be good by invitation," as he once said with reference to
                        some reception engagement.</p>
                    <p>London had accepted Joaquin Miller's pose without qualification. Even the
                        London comic journals, in satirizing it, seemed never to doubt its
                        genuineness. But on this side of the water we had begun to hear rumors that
                        this son of the plains and the mountains, this dweller in solitudes whose
                        limitless silence he himself suggested in the lines: <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">"A land so lone that you wonder whether</l>
                                <l n="2">The God would know it should you fall dead,"</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> was after all a man bred in civilization and acquainted with lands so
                        far from lone that the coroner would be certain to hear of it promptly if
                        death came to one without the intervention of a physician.</p>
                    <p>As he addressed me by my first name from the beginning, and in other ways
                        manifested a disposition to put conventionalities completely aside, I
                        ventured to ask him about one of these rumors, which particularly interested
                        me.</p>
                    <p>"I hear, Mr. Miller," I said, "that you are my compatriotthat you are a
                        Hoosier by birth, as I amis it true?"</p>
                    <p>He sat in meditation for a time; then he said:</p>
                    <p>"George, I've told so many lies about my birth and <pb id="VAA2427-184"
                            n="175"/> all that, that there may be inconsistencies in them. I think
                        I'd better not add to the inconsistencies."</p>
                    <p>I did not press the question. I asked him, instead, to let me have a poem for
                            <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>"I can't," he replied, "I haven't a line of unsold manuscript anywhere on
                        earth, and just now I am devoting myself to horseback riding in Central
                        Park. I've got a seven hundred dollar saddle and I must use it, and you, as
                        an old cavalryman, know how utterly uninspiring a thing it is to amble
                        around Central Park on a horse trained to regard a policeman as a person to
                        be respected, not to say feared, in the matter of speed limits and the
                        proper side of the trail, and all that sort of thing. But that saddle and
                        these boots must be put to the use for which they were built, so I must go
                        on riding in the park till they grow shabby, and I can't think in meter till
                        I get away somewhere where the trees don't stand in rows like sentinels in
                        front of a string of tents, and where the people don't all dress alike. Do
                        you know that is the worst tomfoolery this idiotic world ever gave birth to?
                        It is all right for British soldiers, because there must be some way in
                        which the officers can tell in a crowd who is a soldier and who is not, and
                        besides, regular soldiers aren't men anyhow. They're only ten-pins, to be
                        set up in regular order by one man and bowled over by another.</p>
                    <p>"But what sense is there in men dressing in that way? You and I are tall and
                        slender, but our complexions are different. We are free American citizens.
                        Why should anybody who invites us both to dinner, expect that we shall wear
                        the same sort of clothes? And not only that, why should they expect us to
                        put on precisely the same sort of garments that the big-bellied banker, who
                        is to be our fellow-guest, is sure to wear? It's all nonsense, I tell you.
                        It is an idea born of the uninventive genius of an inane society whose
                        constituent members are as badly <pb id="VAA2427-185" n="176"/> scared at
                        any suggestion of originality or individuality as a woman is at the
                        apparition of a mouse in her bedchamber."</p>
                    <p>I told him I did not agree with him.</p>
                    <p>"The social rule in that respect seems to me a peculiarly sensible and
                        convenient one," I said. "When a man is invited to anything, he knows
                        exactly what to wear. If it be a daytime affair he has only to put on a
                        frock coat with trousers of a lighter color; if it be an evening function a
                        sparrowtailed coat, black trousers, a low cut vest, and a white tie equip
                        him as perfectly as a dozen tailors could. In either case he need not give a
                        thought to his clothes in order to be sure that his costume will be not only
                        correct but so exactly like everybody's else that nobody present will think
                        of it at all. It is a great saving of gray matter, and of money, too, and
                        more important still, it sets men free. The great majority of us couldn't
                        afford to go to any sort of function, however interesting, if we had to
                        dress individually and competitively for it, as women do."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, of course," he answered, "the thing has its advantages, but it is
                        dreadfully monotonouswhat the children call 'samey, samey.'"</p>
                    <p>"By which you mean that it deprives one of all excuse for making himself
                        conspicuous by his dressand that is precisely what most of us do not want to
                        do in any case. Besides, one needn't submit himself to the custom if he
                        objects to it."</p>
                    <p>"That is so," he answered; "at any rate I don't."</p>
                    <p>His practice in the matter was extreme, of course. Even ten years after that
                        he visited the Authors Club with his trousers in his boots, but at the time
                        of my first meeting with him the rule of the "dress coat" was by no means
                        confirmed. It was still a matter of choice with men whether they should wear
                        it or not at evening functions, <pb id="VAA2427-186" n="177"/> and its use
                        at other times of day was still possible without provoking ridicule. At
                        almost every banquet, dinner, or other evening function in those days there
                        were sure to be a number of frock coats worn, and I remember that at the
                        memorable breakfast given in Boston in celebration of Dr. Oliver Wendell
                        Holmes's seventieth birthday in 1879, there were a few guests who wore
                        evening dress, although we sat down to the breakfast at one o'clock and
                        separated before the sun went down. I observed the same thing at two of the
                        breakfasts given to Mr. Edmund Gosse in New York in the early eighties. It
                        was not until near the middle of that decade that the late William Henry
                        Hurlbut authoritatively laid down the law that "a gentleman must never
                        appear without evening dress after six o'clock P.M., and never, <hi rend="i"
                            >never</hi> wear it before that hour, even at a weddingeven at his own
                        wedding."</p>
                    <p>I remember an incident that grew out of this once vexed question, which is
                        perhaps worth recalling. When the Authors Club was founded in 1882, our
                        chief concern was to make it and keep it an informal, brotherly organization
                        of literary men by excluding from its rules and its practices everything
                        that might impose restraint upon social liberty. We aimed at the better kind
                        of Bohemianismthe Bohemianism of liberty, not license; the Bohemianism which
                        disregards all meaningless formalities but respects the decencies and
                        courtesies of social intercourse.</p>
                    <p>Edmund Clarence Stedman was an enthusiastic advocate of this policy. He was
                        beset, he told me at the time, by a great fear that the club might go the
                        way of other organizations with which he was connected; that it might lose
                        its character as an association of authors in sympathy with each other's
                        work and aspirations, and become merely an agency of fashion, a giver of
                        banquets and receptions at which men should be always on dress parade. By
                        way <pb id="VAA2427-187" n="178"/> of averting that degeneracy he proposed
                        for one thing that the members of the club should address each other always
                        by their first names, as schoolboys do. This proved to be impracticable in a
                        club which included such men as Dr. Drisler, Dr. Youmans, President Noah
                        Porter, Bishop Hurst, Parke Godwin, James Russell Lowell, and others of like
                        dignitytogether with a lot of younger men who made their first acquaintance
                        with these in the club itself. But another of Stedman's suggestions met with
                        ready acceptance. He proposed that we should taboo evening dress at our
                        meetings. In playful humor he suggested that if any member should appear at
                        a meeting of the club in that conventional garb, he should be required to
                        stand up before all the company, explain himself, and apologize.</p>
                    <p>We laughingly adopted the rule, and the first person who fell a victim to it
                        was Stedman himself. About ten o'clock one night he entered the club in full
                        dinner dress. Instantly he was arraigned and, standing in the midst of what
                        he called "the clamorous mob," entered upon his explanation. He had come, he
                        said, directly from a philistine dinner at which the garb he wore was as
                        inexorably necessary as combed hair or polished boots or washed hands; his
                        home was far away, and he had been forced to choose between coming to the
                        club in evening dress and not coming at all. Of the two calamities he had
                        chosen the former as the primrose patha path he had always followed instead
                        of the stormy and thorny one, he said, whenever liberty of choice had been
                        his. Then by way of "fruits meet for repentance," he drew from his pocket a
                        black cravat and in the presence of the club substituted it for the white
                        one he had been wearing. At that time no other than a white cravat was
                        permitted with evening dress, so that by this substitution of a black one,
                        he took himself out of the category of the condemned <pb id="VAA2427-188"
                            n="179"/> and became again a companion in good-fellowship over the punch
                        and pipes.</p>

                    <head>XLVII</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was during the early seventies that the inevitable
                        happened, or at least began to happen, with regard to newspaper
                        illustration. The excessive cost of illustrating periodicals by wood
                        engraving, and the time required for its slow accomplishment, together with
                        the growing eagerness of the people for pictures, set a multitude of men of
                        clever wits at work to devise some cheaper and speedier process of
                        reproducing drawings and photographic pictures. I myself invented a very
                        crude and imperfect process of that kind, which I thought susceptible of
                        satisfactory development. I engaged a certain journalist of irregular habits
                        and large pretensions, who was clever with his pencil, to join me in the
                        development and exploitation of the process, he to furnish such drawings of
                        various kinds as I needed, and I to experiment in reproduction. Of course I
                        had to explain my process to him, and he, being a shrewd young man whose
                        moral character was far less admirable than his always perfect costume,
                        mastered my secret and sold it for a trifling sum to a man who promptly
                        patented it and, with a few changes which I had not the cleverness to make,
                        brought it into use as his own.</p>
                    <p>I said some ugly things to my dishonest coadjutor, whose manner of receiving
                        them convinced me that he was well used to hear himself characterized in
                        that way. Then I laughed at myself, went home and read about Moses and the
                        green spectacles, in "The Vicar of Wakefield," and so calmed my spirit.</p>
                    <p>But mine was an extremely unsatisfactory process, even after the inventor who
                        had bought it from my rascally <pb id="VAA2427-189" n="180"/> associate had
                        improved it to the limit of his capacity, and there were far cleverer men at
                        work upon the same problem. By 1874 one of them had so far succeeded that an
                        enterprising firm, owning his patents, decided to set up in New York a daily
                        illustrated newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Graphic.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The failure of the enterprise was freely predicted from the beginning, and in
                        the end failure came to it, but not for the reasons given by the prophets.
                        The <hi rend="i">Graphic</hi> failed chiefly because it never had an editor
                        or manager who knew how to make a newspaper. An additional cause of its
                        failure was its inability to get itself into that great news-gathering
                        trust, the Associated Press, whose agents, local and general, covered the
                        whole country and the whole world with a minuteness that no single newspaper
                        could hope to approach.</p>
                    <p>But while the projectors of the <hi rend="i">Graphic</hi> enterprise were
                        full of their first hopefulness, they bought the good will and the
                        subscription list of <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi>, in order to make of
                        that periodical the weekly edition of their illustrated daily newspaper.</p>
                    <p>This left me "out of a job," but altogether happy. I was very tired. I had
                        had but one week's vacation during my arduous service on <hi rend="i">Hearth
                            and Home.</hi> I had removed to an old Dutch farmhouse in New Jersey
                        because of the impaired health of one dear to me. I had become a contributor
                        to all the great magazines of that time, and a writer of successful books. I
                        was pleased, therefore, to be freed from the Sisyphean labors of the
                        editorial office. I decided to give up newspaper work in all its forms and
                        to devote my future years to literature alone. I retired to my library, the
                        windows of which were overhung by sweet-scented lilacs and climbing roses,
                        beyond which lay an orchard of varied fruits surrounding the old farmhouse.
                        There, I thought I would pass the <pb id="VAA2427-190" n="181"/> remainder
                        of my daysthat phrase felt good in the mind of a work-weary man of
                        thirty-four or about thatin quiet literary work, unvexed by intruding
                        exigencies of any kind. Of course I would write editorials for those great
                        metropolitan dailies for which I was accustomed to do that sort of work from
                        time to time as impulse and opportunity permitted, but I was resolved never
                        again to undertake editorial responsibility of any kind.</p>
                    <p>As illustrative of the part that accident or unforeseen circumstance plays in
                        determining the career of a working man-of-letters, I may relate the story
                        of how I became at that time a writer of boys' fiction as a part of my
                        employment. I was writing at the time for the <hi rend="i">Atlantic</hi>,
                        the <hi rend="i">Galaxy, Appleton's Journal</hi>, and other magazines, and
                        my time was fully occupied, when there came to me a letter asking me upon
                        what terms I would furnish a serial story of adventure for a magazine that
                        made its appeal to boys and girls. Why the editor had thought of me in that
                        connection I cannot imagine. I had never written a boys' storylong or short.
                        I had never written a story of adventure of any sort. I said so in my reply
                        declining to consider the suggestion. A second letter came promptly, urging
                        me to reconsider and asking that I should at any rate name the terms on
                        which I would do the work. Thinking that this opened an easy and certain
                        road of escape, I decided to name terms that I was confident my
                        editor-correspondent would regard as wholly beyond consideration. I wrote
                        him that I would do the story if he would pay me, for serial rights alone,
                        the same price per thousand words that the great magazines were paying me, I
                        to retain the right of book publication, and to have, without charge, the
                        plates of any illustrations the magazine might make for use with my
                        text.</p>
                    <p>Having thus "settled the matter," as I supposed, I dismissed the subject from
                        my mind as a thing done for. <pb id="VAA2427-191" n="182"/> Twenty-four
                        hours later there came a telegram from the editor, saying:</p>
                    <p>"Terms accepted. Write story. Contracts go by mail for execution."</p>
                    <p>Those ten telegraphic words determined my career in an important particular.
                        Also they appalled me. They put me under a contract that I had never thought
                        of making. They placed me under obligation to do a species of literary work
                        which I had never dreamed even of trying to do, and for which I felt myself
                        utterly unfit. It was not only that I had never written a boys' story or
                        thought of writing one; I had never acquainted myself with that sort of
                        literature; I "knew not the trick of it," as the poor fellow in "Hamlet"
                        says when urged to play upon a pipe. Nevertheless, I must do the thing and
                        that immediately, for the correspondence had named a date only three weeks
                        off for the delivery of the first instalment of the manuscript.</p>
                    <p>There was no way of escape. I must set to work upon the story. But what
                        should it be about? Where should its scene be laid? What should be its plot
                        and who its personages? I had not so much as the shadowy ghost of an idea,
                        and during the next twenty-four sleepless hours all my efforts to summon one
                        from the vasty deep or elsewhere brought no result.</p>
                    <p>While I was thus searching a mind vacant of suggestion, my two little boys
                        climbed upon my knees and besought me to tell them "an Injun story." I was
                        in the habit of entertaining their very juvenile minds with exceedingly
                        juvenile fictions manufactured on the spur of the moment, fictions without
                        plot, without beginning or ending of any recognizable sort. Sometimes these
                        "stories" were wholly imaginary; sometimes I drew upon some boyish
                        experience of my own for a subject. This time the specific demand of my
                        exigent little masters for "an Injun <pb id="VAA2427-192" n="183"/> story"
                        led me to think of the Creek War in Alabama and Mississippi. It so happened
                        that some years before the time of this story telling, I had lived for a
                        good many weeks among the Cherokees, Muscogees, and Choctaws in the Indian
                        Territory, hunting with them by day and sleeping with them around a
                        camp-fire by night. I had in that way become interested in their very
                        dramatic history, and on my return to civilization I had read all the
                        literature I could find on the subject of the war in which their power in
                        our Southern states was overthrown, and they themselves, taken by the neck
                        and heels, as it were, out of the very hopefully advancing civilization they
                        had in part borrowed but in greater part wrought out for themselves, and
                        thrown back into the half-savage life from which they had struggled to
                        escape.</p>
                    <p>As I told my little fellows the story they wanted, it occurred to me that
                        here was my subject and inspiration for the larger story I had agreed to
                        write. Within a week or two "The Big Brother" was done and its manuscript
                        delivered.</p>
                    <p>Its serial publication was never completed. When about half the chapters had
                        been printed, the new and ambitious juvenile magazine, <hi rend="i">St.
                            Nicholas</hi>, bought and suppressed the periodical that was publishing
                        it. The Putnams brought my story out in book form, and its success prompted
                        them to ask me for further boys' books, and as the subject of the Creek War
                        was by no means exhausted, I drew upon it for the materials of "Captain Sam"
                        and "The Signal Boys," thus making a trilogy that covered the entire period
                        between the massacre at Fort Mims and the battle of New Orleans.</p>
                    <p>Then I decided that my wholly unintended incursion into the field of youths'
                        fiction should end there. I had never intended to write literature of that
                        kind, and now that I had exhausted the subject of the Creek War, I had <pb
                            id="VAA2427-193" n="184"/> no impulse to hunt for other themes for such
                        use. Besides, I had by that time become absorbed in newspaper work again,
                        and had no time for the writing of books of any sort.</p>
                    <p>It was not until the eighties that I wrote another book of juvenile fiction,
                        and that also came about by accident rather than intention. I had again
                        given up newspaper work, again meaning never to return to it. I was
                        conducting a literary shop of my own in Brooklyn, writing for the magazines,
                        reading for the Harpers, editing the books of other people whose work needed
                        that sort of attention, and doing other things of the kind.</p>
                    <p>One night I was entertaining the younger of the two boys who had suggested
                        the subject of my first work in juvenile fiction. I was telling him of some
                        adventures of my own and others' on the Carolina coast, when suddenly he
                        asked: "Why can't we put all that into a story book?" That evening I
                        received a letter from Mr. George Haven Putnam, saying that while my three
                        "Big Brother" books were still selling pretty well, it would stimulate them
                        helpfully if I could add a new one to the series. In brief, he wanted me to
                        write a new boys' story, and the proposal fitted in so nicely with the
                        suggestion of my little boy that I called the child to me and said:</p>
                    <p>"I think we'll write that story book, if you'll help me."</p>
                    <p>He enthusiastically agreed. I can best tell the rest of that book's story by
                        quoting here from the brief prefatory dedication I wrote for it when it was
                        published in 1882, under the title of "The Wreck of the Redbird":</p>
                    <p>"I intended to dedicate this book to my son, Guilford Dudley Eggleston, to
                        whom it belonged in a peculiar sense. He was only nine years old, but he was
                        my tenderly loved companion, and was in no small degree the creator of this
                        story. He gave it the title it bears; he discussed with <pb id="VAA2427-194"
                            n="185"/> me every incident in it; and every page was written with
                        reference to his wishes and his pleasure. There is not a paragraph here
                        which does not hold for me some reminder of the noblest, manliest, most
                        unselfish boy I have ever known. Ah, woe is me! He who was my companion is
                        my dear dead boy now, and I am sure that I only act for him as he would
                        wish, in inscribing the story that was so peculiarly his to the boy whom he
                        loved best, and who loved him as a brother might have done."</p>
                    <p>It was eighteen years after that that I next wrote a work of fiction for
                        youth, and again the event was the result of suggestion from without. "The
                        Wreck of the Redbird" seems to have made a strong impression upon Elbridge
                        S. Brooks, at that time the literary editor of the Lothrop Publishing
                        Company of Boston, and in the year 1900 he wrote to me asking on what terms
                        I would write for that firm "a boys' story as good as 'The Wreck of the
                        Redbird.'" I had no story in mind at the time. For eighteen years my
                        attention had been absorbed by newspaper work and by literary activities of
                        a sort far removed from this. Moreover, I was at the time working night and
                        day as an editorial writer on the staff of the New York <hi rend="i"
                            >World</hi>, with a good deal of executive duty and responsibility
                        added. But the thought of calling a company of boy readers around me again
                        and telling them a story appealed to my imagination, and, as the terms I
                        suggested were accepted, I employed such odd moments as I could find between
                        other tasks in writing "The Last of the Flatboats." Its success led to other
                        books of the kind, so that since this accidental return to activities of
                        that sort, I have produced six books of juvenile fiction in the intervals of
                        other and more strenuous work.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps an apology is needed for this setting forth of affairs purely
                        personal. If so, it is found in the fact that the illustration given of the
                        part that accident and external <pb id="VAA2427-195" n="186"/> suggestion
                        play in determining the course and character of a professional writer's
                        work, seems to me likely to interest readers who have never been brought
                        into close contact with such things. I have thought it of interest to show
                        visitors through the literary factory and to explain somewhat its
                        processes.</p>

                        orchard-framed, New Jersey farmhouse, I was suddenly jostled out of the
                        comfortable rut in which I had been traveling. A peculiarly plausible and
                        smooth-tongued publisher, a gifted liar, and about the most companionable
                        man I ever knew, had swindled me out of every dollar I had in the world and
                        had made me responsible for a part at least of his debts to others. I held
                        his notes and acceptances for what were to me large sums, and I hold them
                        yet. I held his written assurances, oft-repeated, that whatever might happen
                        to his business affairs, his debt to me was amply and effectually secured. I
                        hold those assurances yetmore than thirty-five years laterand I hold also
                        the showing made by his receiver, to the effect that he had all the while
                        been using my money to secure a secret partner of his own, a highly
                        respectable gentleman who in the course of the settlement proceedings was
                        indicted, convicted, and sent to prison for fraud. But the conviction did
                        not uncover any money with which the debt to me might be liquidated in whole
                        or in part, and the man who had robbed me of all I had in the world had so
                        shrewdly managed matters as to escape all penalties. The last I heard of him
                        he was conducting one of the best-known religious newspapers in the country,
                        and winning laurels as a lecturer on moral and religious subjects, <pb
                            id="VAA2427-196" n="187"/> and especially as a Sunday School worker,
                        gifted in inspiring youth of both sexes with high ethical principles and
                        aspirations.</p>
                    <p>When this calamity befel I had no ready money in possession or within call,
                        and no property of any kind that I could quickly convert into money. I was
                        "stripped to the buff" financially, but I knew my trade as a writer and
                        newspaper man. It was necessary that I should get back to the city at once,
                        and I had no money with which to make the transfer. In this strait I sat
                        down and wrote four magazine articles, writing night and day, and scarcely
                        sleeping at all. The situation was not conducive to sleep. I sent off the
                        articles as fast as they were written, in each case asking the editors for
                        an immediate remittance. They were my personal friends, and I suppose all of
                        them had had experiences not unlike my own. At any rate they responded
                        promptly, and within a week I was settling myself in town and doing such
                        immediate work as I could find to do, while looking for better and more
                        permanent employment.</p>
                    <p>Almost immediately I was summoned to the office of the <hi rend="i">Evening
                            Post</hi>, where I accepted an appointment on the editorial staff. Thus
                        I found myself again engaged in newspaper work, but it was newspaper work of
                        a kind that appealed to my tastes and tendencies. Under Mr. Bryant the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post</hi> was an old-fashioned newspaper of
                        uncondescending, uncompromising dignity. It loathed "sensation" and treated
                        the most sensational newswhen it was obliged to treat it at allin a
                        dignified manner, never forgetting its own self-respect or offending that of
                        its readers. It resolutely adhered to its traditional selling price of five
                        cents a copy, and I am persuaded that the greater number of its constituents
                        would have resented any reduction, especially one involving them in the
                        necessity of giving or taking "pennies" in change.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-197" n="188"/>
                    <p>It did not at all engage in the scramble for "news." It belonged to the
                        Associated Press; it had two or three reporters of its own, educated men and
                        good writers, who could be sent to investigate and report upon matters of
                        public import. It had a Washington correspondent and such other news-getting
                        agents as were deemed necessary under its rule of conduct, which was to
                        regard nothing as published until it was published in the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post</hi>. It was the completest realization I have ever seen
                        of the ideal upon which the <hi rend="i">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> professed to
                        conduct itselfthat of "a newspaper conducted by gentlemen, for
                        gentlemen."</p>
                    <p>It could be trenchant in utterance upon occasion, and when it was so its
                        voice was effectivethe more so because of its habitual moderation and
                        reserve. Sometimes, when the subject to be discussed was one that appealed
                        strongly to Mr. Bryant's convictions and feelings, he would write of it
                        himself. He was an old man and one accustomed to self-control, but when his
                        convictions were stirred, there was not only fire but white-hot lava in his
                        utterance. The lava streams flowed calmly and without rage or turbulence,
                        but they scorched and burned and consumed whatever they touched. More
                        frequently great questions were discussed by some one or other of that outer
                        staff of strong men who, without direct and daily contact with the
                        newspaper, and without salary or pay of any kind, were still regarded by
                        themselves and by the public as parts of the great intellectual and
                        scholarly force in conduct and control of the <hi rend="i">Evening
                        Post</hi>such men, I mean, as Parke Godwin and John Bigelowmen once members
                        of that newspaper's staff and still having free access to its columns when
                        they had aught that they wished to say on matters of public concern.</p>
                    <p>Best of all, so far as my tastes and inclinations were concerned, the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post</hi>, under Mr. Bryant's and <pb id="VAA2427-198"
                            n="189"/> later Mr. Parke Godwin's control, regarded and treated
                        literature and scholarship as among the chief forces of civilized life and
                        the chief concerns of a newspaper addressing itself to the educated class in
                        the community. Whatsoever concerned literature or scholarship, whatsoever
                        was in any wise related to those things, whatever concerned education,
                        culture, human advancement, commanded the <hi rend="i">Evening Post's</hi>
                        earnest attention and sympathy. It discussed grave measures of state pending
                        at Washington or Albany or elsewhere, but it was at no pains to record the
                        gossip of great capitals. Personalities had not then completely usurped the
                        place of principles and policies in the attention of newspapers, and the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post</hi> gave even less attention to such things than
                        most of its contemporaries did. The time had not yet come among newspapers
                        when circulation seemed of greater importance than character, when the
                        details of a divorce scandal or a murder trial seemed of more consequence
                        than the decisions of the Supreme Court, or when a brutal slugging match
                        between two low-browed beasts in human form was regarded as worthy of
                        greater newspaper space than a discussion of the tariff on art or the
                        appearance of an epoch-making book by Tennyson or Huxley or Haeckel.</p>
                    <p>In brief, the newspapers of that time had not learned the baleful lesson that
                        human society is a cone, broadest at bottom, and that the lower a newspaper
                        cuts into it the broader its surface of circulation is. They had not yet
                        reconciled themselves to the thought of appealing to low tastes and degraded
                        impulses because that was the short road to multitudinous "circulation,"
                        with its consequent increase in "advertising patronage."</p>
                    <p>Most of the newspapers of that time held high standards, and the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post</hi>, under Mr. Bryant's control, was the most exigent of
                        all in that respect.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-199" n="190"/>
                    <p>Another thing. The book notice" had not yet taken the place of the capable
                        and conscientious review. It had not yet occurred to editors generally that
                        the purpose of the literary columns was to induce advertisements from
                        publishers, and that anybody on a newspaper staff who happened to have
                        nothing else to do, or whose capacities were small, might be set to
                        reviewing books, whether he happened to know anything about literature or
                        not.</p>
                    <p>It was the custom of the better newspapers then, both in New York and
                        elsewhere, to employ as their reviewers men eminent for literary scholarship
                        and eminently capable of literary appreciation. Among the men so employed at
                        that timeto mention only a few by way of examplewere George Ripley, Richard
                        Henry Stoddard, E. P. Whipple, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Charles Dudley
                        Warner, R. R. Bowker, W. C. Wilkinson, Charles F. Briggs, and others of like
                        gifts and accomplishments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bryant himself had exercised this function through long years that won
                        distinction from his work for his newspaper. As advancing years compelled
                        him to relinquish that toil, he surrendered it cautiously into other hands,
                        but in whatever hands it might be, Mr. Bryant followed it more minutely and
                        with a more solicitous interest than he gave to any other part of the
                        newspaper.</p>
                    <p>At the time when I joined the staff there was a sort of interregnum in the
                        literary department. John R. Thompson, who had held the place of literary
                        editor for some years, was dead, and nobody had been found who could fill
                        the place to Mr. Bryant's satisfaction. There were men who wrote with grace
                        and discretion, and whose familiarity with current literature was adequate,
                        but Mr. Bryant objected that they were altogether men of the present, that
                        they knew little or nothing of the older literature of our language, and
                        hence, as he contended, <pb id="VAA2427-200" n="191"/> had no adequate
                        standards of comparison in their minds. Of one who essayed the work he said
                        that his attitude of mind was too flippant, that he cared more for what he
                        himself wrote about books under review than for what the authors of those
                        books had written. Another, he said, lacked generosity of sympathy with
                        halting but sincere literary endeavor, and so on with others.</p>
                    <p>My own editorial work was exigent at the time and there was added to it the
                        task of finding a satisfactory person to become literary editor. I knew Mr.
                        Bryant very slightly at the time, and I doubt that he knew me at all, in
                        person, but he knew how wide my acquaintance among literary men had become
                        in the course of my experience on <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi>, and he
                        bade the managing editor, Mr. Watson R. Sperry, make use of it in the
                        search. In common with most other men in the newspaper business, I regarded
                        the position of literary editor of the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> as the
                        most desirable one in American journalism. I frankly told Mr. Sperry that I
                        should myself like the appointment if Mr. Bryant could in any wise be
                        satisfied of my fitness. I was at the time writing all the more important
                        book reviews by way of helping in the emergency.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sperry replied that Mr. Bryant had already suggested my appointment, as
                        he was pleased with my work, but that he, Mr. Sperry, did not want to spare
                        me from certain other things that I was doing for him, and further, that he
                        thought the literary editor of the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> should be
                        a man whose reputation and position as a recognized man of letters were well
                        established, as mine were not.</p>
                    <p>I agreed with him in that opinion and went on with my quest. Among those to
                        whom I wrote was Thomas Bailey Aldrich. I set forth to him as attractively
                        as I could, the duties of the place, the dignity attaching to <pb
                            id="VAA2427-201" n="192"/> it, the salary it carried, and everything
                        else of a persuasive sort that I could call to mind.</p>
                    <p>For reply Mr. Aldrich wrote that the position was one in every way to be
                        coveted, and added:</p>
                    <p>"But, my dear Eggleston, what can the paper offer to compensate one for
                        having to live in New York? "</p>
                    <p>Years afterward I tried to extract from him some apology to New York for that
                        fling, but without success.</p>
                    <p>One day, while I was still engaged in this fruitless search, Mr. Bryant
                        entered the libraryoff which my little den openedand began climbing about on
                        a ladder and turning over books, apparently in search of something.</p>
                    <p>I volunteered the suggestion that perhaps I could assist him if he would tell
                        me what it was he was trying to find.</p>
                    <p>"I think not," he answered, taking down another volume from the shelves.
                        Then, as if conscious that his reply might have seemed ungraciously curt, he
                        turned toward me and said:</p>
                    <p>"I'm looking for a line that I ought to know where to find, but do not."</p>
                    <p>He gave me the substance of what he sought and fortunately I recognized it as
                        a part of a half-remembered passage in one of Abraham Cowley's poems. I told
                        Mr. Bryant so, and while he sat I found what he wanted. Apparently his
                        concern for it was gone. Instead of looking at the book which I had placed
                        in his hands open at the desired page, he turned upon me and asked:</p>
                    <p>"How do you happen to know anything about Cowley?"</p>
                    <p>I explained that as a youth, while idling time away on an old Virginia
                        plantation, where there was a library of old books, as there was on every
                        other ancestral plantation round about, I had fallen to reading all I could
                            <pb id="VAA2427-202" n="193"/> find at home or in neighboring houses of
                        the old English literature, of which I had had a maddening taste even as a
                        little boy; that I had read during those plantation summers every old book I
                        could find in any of the neglected libraries round about.</p>
                    <p>My work for the day lay unfinished on my desk, but Mr. Bryant gave no heed to
                        it. He questioned me concerning my views of this and that in literature, my
                        likes and dislikes, my estimates of classic English works, and of the men
                        who had produced them. Now and then he challenged my opinions and set me to
                        defend them. After a while he took his leave in his usual undemonstrative
                        fashion.</p>
                    <p>"Good-afternoon," was absolutely his only word of parting, and after he had
                        gone I wondered if I had presumed too much in the fearless expression of my
                        opinions or in combating his own, or whether I had offended him in some
                        other way For I knew him very slightly then and misinterpreted a reticence
                        that was habitual with himeven constitutional, I think. Still less did I
                        understand that during that talk of two hours' duration he had been
                        subjecting me to a rigid examination in English literature.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> of that afternoon published my review of
                        an important book, which I had tried to treat with the care it deserved. I
                        learned afterwards that the article pleased Mr. Bryant, but whether or not
                        it had any influence upon what followed I do not know. What followed was
                        this: the next day a little before noon, Mr. Sperry came into my den with a
                        laugh and a frown playing tag on his face.</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Bryant has just been in," he said. " He walked into my room and said to
                        me: ' Mr. Sperry, I have appointed Mr. Eggleston literary editor.
                        Good-morning, Mr. Sperry.' And with that he left again, giving me <pb
                            id="VAA2427-203" n="194"/> no time to say a word. In a way, I'm glad,
                        but I shall miss you from your other work."</p>
                    <p>I reassured him, telling him I could easily do those parts of that other work
                        for which he most needed me, and so the matter was "arranged to the
                        satisfaction of everybody concerned," as the dueling people used to say when
                        two blustering cowards had apologized instead of shooting each other.</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>XLIX</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HUS</hi> began an acquaintance with Mr. Bryant that quickly
                        became as intimate as I suppose any acquaintance with him ever didor at any
                        rate any acquaintance begun after the midyears of his life. Once in a while
                        I passed a Sunday with him at his Roslyn home, but chiefly such converse as
                        I enjoyed with him was held in the office of the <hi rend="i">Evening
                            Post</hi>, and of course it was always of his seeking, as I scrupulously
                        avoided intruding myself upon his attention. Our interviews usually occurred
                        in this way: he would enter the library, which communicated with my little
                        writing room by an open doorway, and after looking over some books, would
                        enter my room and settle himself in a chair, with some remark or question.
                        The conversation thus began would continue for such time as he chose, ten
                        minutes, half an hour, two hours, as his leisure and inclination might
                        determine.</p>
                    <p>It was always gentle, always kindly, always that of two persons interested in
                        literature and in all that pertains to what in the culture-slang of this
                        later time is somewhat tiresomely called "uplift." It was always inspiring
                        and clarifying to my mind, always encouraging to me, always richly
                        suggestive on his part, and often quietly humorous in a fashion that is
                        nowhere suggested in any <pb id="VAA2427-204" n="195"/> of Mr. Bryant's
                        writings. I have searched them in vain for the smallest trace of the humor
                        he used to inject into his talks with me, and I think I discover in its
                        absence, and in some other peculiarities of his, an explanation of certain
                        misjudgments of him which prevailed during his life and which endure still
                        in popular conception.</p>
                    <p>The reader may perhaps recall Lowell's criticism of him in " A Fable for
                        Critics." The substance of it was that Mr. Bryant was intensely cold of
                        nature and unappreciative of human things. I wish to bear emphatic witness
                        that nothing could be further from the truth, though Lowell's judgment is
                        the one everywhere accepted.</p>
                    <p>The lack of warmth usually attributed to Mr. Bryant, I found to be nothing
                        more than the personal reserve common to New Englanders of culture and
                        refinement, plus an excessive personal modesty and a shyness of
                        self-revelation, and self-intrusion, which is usually found only in young
                        girls just budding into womanhood.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bryant shrank from self-assertion even of the most impersonal sort, as I
                        never knew any other human being to do. He cherished his own opinions
                        strongly, but he thrust them upon nobody. His dignity was precious to him,
                        but his only way of asserting it was by withdrawal from any conversation or
                        company that trespassed upon it.</p>
                    <p>Above all, emotion, to him, was a sacred thing, not to be exploited or even
                        revealed. In ordinary intercourse with his fellow-men he hid it away as one
                        instinctively hides the privacies of the toilet. He could no more lay his
                        feelings bare to common scrutiny than he could have taken his bath in the
                        presence of company.</p>
                    <p>In the intimate talks he and I had together during the last half dozen years
                        of his life, he laid aside his reserve, so far as it was possible for a man
                        of his sensitive nature to do, and I found him not only warm in his human
                        sympathies, but even passionate. If we find little of this <pb
                            id="VAA2427-205" n="196"/> in his writings, it is only because in what
                        he wrote he was addressing the public, and shyly withholding himself from
                        revelation. Yet there is passion and there is hot blood, even there, as who
                        can deny who has read " The Song of Marion's Men," or his superb
                        interpretation of Homer?</p>
                    <p>There is a bit of literary history connected with " The Song of Marion's
                        Men," which may be mentioned here as well as anywhere else. The venerable
                        poet one day told me the facts concerning it.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Bryant issued the first collected edition of his poems, English
                        publication was very necessary to the success of such a work in America,
                        which was still provincial. Accordingly Mr. Bryant desired English
                        publication. Washington Irving was then living in England, and Mr. Bryant
                        had a slight but friendly acquaintance with him. It was sufficient to
                        justify the poet in asking the great story teller's friendly offices. He
                        sent a copy of his poems to Irving, asking him to secure a London publisher.
                        This Irving did, with no little trouble, and in the face of many obstacles
                        of prejudice, indifference, and the like.</p>
                    <p>When half the book was in type the publisher sent for Irving in
                        consternation. He had discovered, in "The Song of Marion's Men," the
                        lines:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">"The British soldier trembles</l>
                        <l n="2">When Marion's name is told."</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>It would never, never do, he explained, for him to publish a book with even
                        the smallest suggestion in it that the British soldier was a man to "
                        tremble " at any danger. It would simply ruin him to publish this direct
                        charge of cowardice against Tommy Atkins.</p>
                    <p>For the time Irving was at a loss to know what to do. Mr. Bryant was three
                        thousand miles away and the only way of communicating with him was by ocean
                        mails, carried <pb id="VAA2427-206" n="197"/> by sailing craft at long
                        intervals, low speed, and uncertain times of arrival. To write to him and
                        get a reply would require a waste of many weeksperhaps of several months. In
                        his perplexed anxiety to serve his friend, Irving decided to take the
                        liberty of making an entirely innocent alteration in the words, curing them
                        of their offensiveness to British sensitiveness, without in the least
                        altering their significance. Instead of: <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>

                                <l n="2">When Marion's name is told,"</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> he made the lines read: <q direct="unspecified">

                        </q>

                    <p>"So far as I was concerned," said Mr. Bryant in telling me of the matter,
                        "what Irving did seemed altogether an act of friendly intervention, the more
                        so because the acquaintance between him and me was very slight at that time.
                        He was a warm-hearted man, who in doing a thing of that kind, reckoned upon
                        a slight friendship for justification, as confidently as men of natures less
                        generous might reckon upon a better established acquaintance. He always took
                        comradery for granted, and where his intentions were friendly and helpful,
                        he troubled himself very little with formal explanations that seemed to him
                        wholly unnecessary. I had asked him to secure the publication of my poems in
                        England, a thing that only his great influence there could have accomplished
                        at that time. He had been at great pains and no little trouble to accomplish
                        my desire. Incidentally, it had become necessary for him either to accept
                        defeat in that purpose or to make that utterly insignificant alteration in
                        my poem. I was grateful to him for doing so, but I did not understand <pb
                            id="VAA2427-207" n="198"/> his careless neglect to write to me promptly
                        on the subject. I did not know him then as I afterwards learned to do. The
                        matter troubled me very little or not at all; but possibly I mentioned his
                        inattention in some conversation with Coleman, of the <hi rend="i">Evening
                            Post</hi>. I cannot now remember whether I did so or not, but at any
                        rate, Coleman, who was both quick and hot of temper, and often a trifle
                        intemperate in criticism, took the matter up and dealt severely with Irving
                        for having taken the liberty of altering lines of mine without my
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>"The affair gave rise to the report, which you have perhaps heardfor it
                        persiststhat Irving and I quarreled and became enemies. Nothing could be
                        further from the truth. We were friends to the day of his death."</p>
                    <p>Inasmuch as different versions of the Irving-Bryant affair are extant, it
                        seems proper to say that immediately after the conversation ended I put into
                        writing all that I have here directly quoted from Mr. Bryant. I did not show
                        the record of it to him for verification, for the reason that I knew him to
                        be sensitive on the subject of what he once referred to as " the eagerness
                        of a good many persons to become my literary executors before I am dead."
                        That was said with reference to the irksome attempts a certain distinguished
                        literary hack was making to draw from. Mr. Bryant the materials for articles
                        that would sell well whenever the aged poet should die.</p>
                    <p>After a seance with that distinguished toady one day, Mr. Bryant came to me,
                        in some disturbance of mind, to ask for a volume of verse that I had just
                        reviewedto soothe his spirit, he said. Then he told me of the visitation he
                        had had, and said:</p>
                    <p>"I tried to be patient, but I fear I was rude to him at the last. There
                        seemed to be no other way of getting rid of him."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-208" n="199"/>
                    <p>Alas, even rudeness had not baffled the bore; for when Mr. Bryant died the
                        pestilent person published a report of that very interview, putting into the
                        poet's mouth many utterances directly contrary to Mr. Bryant's oft-expressed
                        opinions.</p>

                    <p>E<hi rend="sc">XIGENT</hi> and solicitous as he was with reference to every
                        utterance in the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> concerning literature, Mr.
                        Bryant never interfered with my perfect liberty as literary editor, except
                        in the one matter of the treatment of poets and poetry.</p>
                    <p>"Deal gentlyvery gently, with the poets," he said to me at the time of my
                        assumption of that office. " Remember always, that the very sensitiveness of
                        soul which makes a man a poet, makes him also peculiarly and painfully
                        susceptible to wounds of the spirit."</p>
                    <p>I promised to bear his admonition in mind, and I did so, sometimes perhaps to
                        the peril of my soulcertainly at risk of my reputation for critical acumen
                        and perhaps for veracity. One day, however, I encountered a volume of verse
                        so ridiculously false in sentiment, extravagant in utterance, and inane in
                        character, that I could not refrain from poking a little fun at its
                        absurdity. The next day Mr. Bryant came to see me. After passing the time of
                        day, he said:</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Eggleston, I hope you will not forget my desire that you shall deal
                        gently with the poets."</p>
                    <p>I replied that I had borne it constantly in mind.</p>
                    <p>"I don't know," he answered, shaking his head; " what you said yesterday
                        about X. Y. Z.'s volume did not seem to me very gentle."</p>
                    <p>"Considered absolutely," I replied, " perhaps it wasn't. But considered in
                        the light of the temptation I was under <pb id="VAA2427-209" n="200"/> to
                        say immeasurably severer things, it was mild and gentle in an extreme
                        degree. The man is not a poet, but a fool. He not only hasn't the smallest
                        appreciation of what poetry is or means, but he hasn't the ability to
                        entertain a thought of any kind worthy of presentation in print or in any
                        other way. I should have stultified my self and the <hi rend="i">Evening
                            Post</hi> if I had written more favorably of his work than I did. I
                        should never have thought of writing of it at all, but for the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post's</hi> rule that every book offered here for review must
                        be mentioned in some way in the literary columns. Here is the book. I wish
                        you would glance at the alleged poems and tell me how I could have said
                        anything concerning them of a more considerately favorable character than
                        what in fact I printed."</p>
                    <p>He took the book from my hand and looked it over. Then he laid it on my desk,
                        saying:</p>
                    <p>"It is indeed pretty bad. Still, I have always found that it is possible to
                        find something good to say about a poet's work."</p>
                    <p>A little later a still worse case came to my lot. It was a volume of "
                        verse," with no sense at all in it, without even rhythm to redeem it, and
                        with an abundance of " rhymes " that were not easily recognizable even as
                        assonances. It was clumsily printed and " published" at some rural newspaper
                        office, and doubtless at the expense of the author. Finally the cover
                        attempt at decoration had resulted in a grotesque combination of
                        incompatible colors and inconsequent forms. In brief, the thing was
                        execrably, hopelessly, irredeemably bad all over and clear through.</p>
                    <p>I was puzzling ever the thing, trying to " find something good to say " of
                        it, when Mr. Bryant came into my den. I handed him the volume, saying:</p>
                    <p>"I wish you would help me with a suggestion, Mr. <pb id="VAA2427-210" n="201"
                        /> Bryant. I'm trying to find something good that I can say of that thing,
                        and I can'tfor of course you do not want me to write lies."</p>
                    <p>"Lies? Of course not. But you can always find something good in every volume
                        of poems, something that can be truthfully commended."</p>
                    <p>"In this case I can't regard the sprawlings of illdirected aspiration as
                        poems," I replied, " and it seems to me a legitimate function of criticism
                        to say that they are not poems but idiotic drivelto discriminate between
                        poetry in its unworthiest form and things like that. I lowever, the man
                        calls his stuft poetry. I wish you would help me find something good that I
                        may say of it without lying."</p>
                    <p>He took the book and looked through it. Finally he said:</p>
                    <p>"It is pretty sorry stuff, to be sure. It is even idiotic, and it doesn't
                        suggest poetic appreciation or poetic impulse or poetic perception on the
                        part of its author. Still, the man aspires to recognition as a poet, and he
                        is doubtless sensitively conscious of his own shortcomings. Let us deal
                        gently with him."</p>
                    <p>"But what can I say, Mr. Bryant? "</p>
                    <p>"Well, of course, there is nothing <hi rend="i">inside</hi> the book that you
                        can praise," he answered, " but you might commend the coverno, that is an
                        affront to taste and intelligence,"</p>
                    <p>looking it over with an expression of disgust" but at any rate you can
                        commend the publishers for <hi rend="i">putting it on well.</hi>"</p>
                    <p>"With thatapparently dreading further questioninghe left the room. I
                        proceeded to review the book by saying simply that the cover was put on so
                        strongly that even the most persistent and long continued enjoyment or
                        critical study of the text was not likely to detach or loosen it.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-211" n="202"/>
                    <p>I am disposed to think that Mr. Bryant's excessive tenderness toward poets
                        was lavished chiefly upon the weaklings of that order. For a little while
                        later a poet of genuine inspiration, who afterwards did notable work, put
                        forward his first volume of verse. I found an abundance of good things to
                        say about it, but there was one line in one of his poems that was so
                        ridiculously inconsequent and absurd, that I could not refrain from poking
                        fun at it. I am convinced that the poet in question, with his larger
                        experience and the development that afterward came to his critical
                        faculties, would not have permitted that line to stand if it had occurred in
                        a poem of a later period. It appealed to him then by its musical quality,
                        which was distinctly marked, but when subjected to the simplest analysis it
                        was obvious and arrant nonsense.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bryant was interested in the review I wrote of the volume, and in talking
                        with me about it, he distinctly chuckled over my destructive analysis of the
                        offending line. There was no suggestion in what he said, that he regarded
                        the criticism as in the least a transgression of his injunction to " deal
                        gently with the poets."</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the poet criticised seemed less tolerant of the criticism. He
                        was a personal friend of my own, but when next I saw him his mood was that
                        of one cruelly injured, and for many years thereafter he manifested this
                        sense of injury whenever he and I met. I think he afterward forgave me, for
                        we later became the best of friends, and I am glad to believe there was no
                        rancor in his heart toward me when he died a little while ago.</p>
                    <p>In these cases I was at a peculiar disadvantagethough I think it not at all
                        an unjust onein every indulgence in anything like adverse criticism. I may
                        best explain this, perhaps, by telling of an incident that happened soon
                        after I assumed my position. I had been lucky enough to secure from Richard
                        Henry Stoddard a very <pb id="VAA2427-212" n="203"/> brilliant review of a
                        certain book which he was peculiarly the fittest man in all the land to
                        write about. I had the review in type, when I mentioned to Mr. Bryant my
                        good fortune in securing it.</p>
                    <p>"Is it signed? " he asked in his gentlest manner.</p>
                    <p>I answered that it was not, for the reason that Stoddard was under a certain
                        assertion of obligation which he refused to recognize but which I could not
                        ask him to repudiate, not to write things of that character for other than a
                        particular publication.</p>
                    <p>"Then I request that you shall not use it," said Mr. Bryant.</p>
                    <p>"But really, Mr. Bryant, there is not the smallest obligation upon him in the
                        matter. He is perfectly free"</p>
                    <p>"It is not of that that I was thinking," he interrupted. " That is a matter
                        between him and his own conscience, and you and I have nothing whatever to
                        do with it. My objection to your use of the article is that I regard <hi
                            rend="i">an anonymous literary criticism as a thing quite as despicable,
                            unmanly, and cowardly as an anonymous letter.</hi> It is something that
                        no honorable man should write, and no honorably conducted newspaper should
                        publish."</p>
                    <p>"But my own reviews in the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> are all of them
                        anonymous," I suggested.</p>
                    <p>"Not at all," he answered. " When you were appointed literary editor the fact
                        was communicated to every publisher in the country. I directed that and saw
                        that it was done, so that every publisher and, through the publishers, every
                        author, should know that every literary criticism in the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post</hi> was your utterance. In veritable effect, therefore,
                        everything you print in our literary columns is signed, just as every
                        critical article in the great British reviews is. When Jeffrey ridiculed
                        'Hours of Idleness,' and later, when he seriously criticised ' Cain,' Byron
                        had no need to inquire who his critic was. The <pb id="VAA2427-213" n="204"
                        /> work was responsibly done, as such work should be in every case. The
                        reasons seem to me obvious enough. In the first place, anonymous literary
                        criticism may easily become a cowardly stabbing in the back under cover of
                        darkness. In the second place, the reader of such criticism has no means of
                        knowing what value to place upon it. He cannot know whether the critic is a
                        person competent or incompetent, one to whose opinions he should defer or
                        one whose known incapacity would prompt him to dismiss them as unworthy of
                        consideration because of their source. In the third place, anonymous
                        literary criticism opens wide the door of malice on the one hand, and of
                        undue favoritism on the other. It is altogether despicable, and it is
                        dangerous besides. I will have none of it on the <hi rend="i">Evening
                            Post.</hi>"</p>
                    <p>I suggested that I had myself read the book that Stoddard had reviewed, and
                        that I was ready to accept his criticism as my own and to hold myself
                        responsible for it.</p>
                    <p>"Very well," he replied. " In that case you may print it as your own, but I
                        had much rather you had written it yourself."</p>
                    <p>I have often meditated upon these things since, and I have found abundant
                        reason to adopt Mr. Bryant's view that an anonymous literary criticism is as
                        despicable as an anonymous letter. About a year ago I was startled by the
                        utterance of precisely the same thought in nearly identical words, by
                        Professor Brander Matthews. I was sitting between him and Mr. Howells at a
                        banquet given by Colonel William C. Church to the surviving writers for that
                        best and most literary of American magazines, <hi rend="i">The Galaxy</hi>,
                        and when Matthews uttered the thought I turned to Mr. Howells and asked him
                        what his opinion was.</p>
                    <p>"I have never formulated my thought on that question, even in my own mind,"
                        he replied. " I don't know how <pb id="VAA2427-214" n="205"/> far it would
                        be just to judge others in the matter, but for myself, I think I never wrote
                        a literary criticism that was not avowedly or ascertainably my own. Without
                        having thought of the ethical question involved, my own impulse is to shrink
                        from the idea of striking in the dark or from behind a mask."</p>

                    <head>LI</head>
                    <p>O<hi rend="sc">N</hi> one occasion Mr. Bryant's desire to " deal gently with
                        the poets " led to an amusing embarrassment. Concerning a certain volume of
                        verse " made in Ohio " and published by its author, I had writtten that "
                        this is the work of a man who seems to have an alert appreciation of the
                        poetic side of things, but whose gift of poetic interpretation and literary
                        expression is distinctly a minus quantity."</p>
                    <p>Soon afterward Mr. Bryant entered my den with an open letter in his hand and
                        a look of pained perplexity on his face.</p>
                    <p>"What am I to do with that? " he asked, handing me the letter to read.</p>
                    <p>I read it. The poet, knowing Mr. Bryant to be the editor of the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post</hi>, evidently supposed that he wrote everything that
                        appeared in the columns of that newspaper. Assuming that Mr. Bryant had
                        written the review of his book, he wrote asking that he might be permitted
                        to use the first half of my sentence as an advertisement, with Mr. Bryant's
                        name signed to it. To facilitate matters he had prepared, on a separate
                        sheet, a transcript of the words:</p>
                    <p>"This is the work of a man who seems to have an alert appreciation of the
                        poetic side of things."</p>
                    <p>This he asked Mr. Bryant to sign and return to him <pb id="VAA2427-215"
                            n="206"/> for use as an advertisement, explaining that " Your great name
                        will help me to sell my book, and I need the money. It cost me nearly two
                        hundred dollars to get the book out, and so far I haven't been able to sell
                        more than twenty-seven copies of it, though I have canvassed three counties
                        at considerable expense for food, lodging, and horse-feed."</p>
                    <p>I saw how seriously distressed Mr. Bryant was by this appeal, and volunteered
                        to answer the letter myself, by way of relieving him. I answered it, but I
                        did not report the nature of my answer to Mr. Bryant, for the reason that in
                        my personal letter I dealt by no means " gently " with this particular
                        poet.</p>
                    <p>For the further distraction of Mr. Bryant's mind from a matter that
                        distressed him sorely, I told him of the case in which a thrifty and shifty
                        London publisher turned to good advertising account one of the <hi rend="i"
                            >Saturday Review's</hi> most murderous criticisms. The <hi rend="i"
                            >Review</hi> had written:</p>
                    <p>"There is much that is good in this book, and much that is new. But that
                        which is good is not new, and that which is new is not good."</p>
                    <p>The publisher, in his advertisements, made display of the sentence: "There is
                        much that is good in this book, and much that is new.<hi rend="i">Saturday
                            Review.</hi>"</p>
                    <p>One thing leads to another in conversation and I went onby way of the further
                        diversion of Mr. Bryant's mindto illustrate the way in which the <hi
                            rend="i">Saturday Review</hi>, like many other publications, sometimes
                        ruined its richest utterances by dilution. I cited a case in which that
                        periodical had begun a column review of a wishy-washy book by saying:</p>
                    <p>"This is milk for babes, with water superadded. The milk is pure and the
                        water is pure, but the diet is not invigorating."</p>
                    <p>As a bit of destructive criticism, this was complete and <pb id="VAA2427-216"
                            n="207"/> perfect. But the writer spoiled it by going on to write a
                        column of less trenchant matter, trampling, as it were, and quite
                        needlessly, upon the corpse of the already slain offender.</p>
                    <p>The habit of assuming that the distinguished editor of a newspaper writes
                        everything of consequence that appears in its columns, is not confined to
                        rural poets in Ohio, as three occurrences during my service on the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post</hi> revealed to me.</p>
                    <p>When a great Poe celebration was to be held in Baltimore, on the occasion of
                        the unveiling of a monument or something of that kind, Mr. Bryant was
                        earnestly urged to send something to be read on the occasion and published
                        as a part of the proceedings. He had no stomach for the undertaking. It was
                        said among those who knew him best that his personal feelings toward Poe's
                        memory were of a bitterly antagonistic kind. However that may beand I do not
                        know whether it was true or nothe was resolute in his determination to have
                        no part or lot in this Poe celebration. In reply to the urgent invitations
                        sent him, he wrote a carefully colorless note, excusing himself on the plea
                        of " advancing age."</p>
                    <p>When the day of the celebration came, however, I wrote a long, critical
                        appreciation of Poe, with an analysis of his character, borrowed mainly from
                        what Charles F. Briggs had said to me. My article was published as an
                        editorial in the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi>, and straightway half a
                        dozen prominent newspapers in different cities reprinted it under the
                        headline of " William Cullen Bryant's Estimate of Poe."</p>
                    <p>Fearing that Mr. Bryant might be seriously annoyed at being thus made
                        responsible for an " estimate of Poe" which he had been at pains not to
                        write, I went to his room to speak with him about the matter.</p>
                    <p>"Don't let it trouble you, my dear boy," he said in <pb id="VAA2427-217"
                            n="208"/> his most patient manner. " We are both paying the penalty of
                        journalistic anonymity. I am held responsible for utterances not my own, and
                        you are robbed of the credit due you for a very carefully written
                        article."</p>
                    <p>Again, on the occasion of Longfellow's seventieth birthday, Mr. Bryant
                        resisted all entreaties for any utteranceeven the briefestfrom him. I was
                        assigned to write the necessary editorial article, and when it appeared, one
                        of the foremost newspapers in the country reprinted it as " One Great Poet's
                        Tribute to Another," and in an introductory paragraph explained that, while
                        the article was not signed, it was obviously from Mr. Bryant's pen.</p>
                    <p>During the brief time that I remained on the <hi rend="i">Evening Post's</hi>
                        staff after Mr. Carl Schurz became its editor, I wrote a rather elaborate
                        review of Colonel Theodore Dodge's book, " The Campaign of
                        Chancellorsville." The <hi rend="i">Springfield Republican</hi> reprinted it
                        prominently, saying that it had special importance as " the comment of
                        General Schurz on a campaign in which he had borne a conspicuous part."</p>
                    <p>When it was given out that Martin Farquhar Tupper intended to visit America
                        during the Centennial Exposition of 1876, I wrote a playful article about
                        the "Proverbial Philosophy " man and handed it to the managing editor for
                        publication as a humorous editorial. Mr. Sperry was amused by the article,
                        but distressingly perplexed by apprehensions concerning it. He told me of
                        the difficulty. It seems that some years before that time, during a visit to
                        England, Mr. Bryant had been very hospitably entertained by Tupper,
                        wherefore Sperry feared that Mr. Bryant might dislike the publication of the
                        article. At the same time he was reluctant to lose the fun of it.</p>
                    <p>"Why not submit the question to Mr. Bryant himself?" <pb id="VAA2427-218"
                            n="209"/> I suggested, and as Mr. Bryant entered at that moment Sperry
                        acted upon the suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bryant read the article with many manifestations of amusement, but when
                        he had finished he said:</p>
                    <p>"I heartily wish, Mr. Sperry, you had printed this without saying a word to
                        me about it, for then, when Mr. Tupper becomes my guest, as he will if he
                        comes to America, I could have explained to him that the thing was done
                        without my knowledge by one of the flippant young men of my staff. Now that
                        you have brought the matter to my attention, I can make no excuse."</p>
                    <p>Sperry pleaded that Tupper's coming was not at all a certainty, adding:</p>
                    <p>"And at any rate, he will not be here for several months to come, and he'll
                        never know that the article was published or written."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes he will," responded Mr. Bryant. " Some damned, good-natured friend
                        will be sure to bring it to his attention."</p>
                    <p>As Mr. Bryant never swore, the phrase was of course a quotation.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>LII</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HERE</hi> has been a deal of nonsense written and published
                        with respect to Mr. Bryant's <hi rend="i">Index Expurgatorius</hi>, a deal
                        of arrogance, and much cheap and ill-informed wit of a certain " superior "
                        sort expended upon it. So far as I have seen these comments, they have all
                        been founded upon ignorance of the facts and misconception of Mr. Bryant's
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, Mr. Bryant never published the index and never intended
                        it to be an expression of his views with respect to linguistic usage. He
                        prepared it solely for office use, and it was meant only to check certain
                            <pb id="VAA2427-219" n="210"/> tendencies of the time so far as the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post</hi> was concerned. The reporters on more
                        sensational newspapers had come to call every big fire a " carnival of
                        flame," every formal dinner a " banquet," and to indulge in other verbal
                        exaggerations and extravagances of like sort. Mr. Bryant catalogued these
                        atrocities in his <hi rend="i">Index</hi> and forbade their use on the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He was an intense conservative as to the English language, and his conscience
                        was exceedingly alert to preserve it in its purity, so far as it was within
                        his power to do so. Accordingly he ruled out of <hi rend="i">Evening
                            Post</hi> usage a number of things that were creeping into the language
                        to its corruption, as he thought. Among these were the use of "numerous "
                        where " many " was meant, the use of " people " for " persons," " monthly "
                        for " monthly magazine," "paper" for "newspaper," and the like. He objected
                        to the phrase " those who," meaning " those persons who," and above all his
                        soul revolted against the use of " such " as an adverbas in the phrase "
                        such ripe strawberries " which, he contended, should be " so ripe
                        strawberries " or " strawberries so ripe." The fact that Webster's and
                        Worcester's dictionaries recognized many of the condemned usages, made not
                        the smallest Impression on his mind.</p>
                    <p>"He must be a poor scholar," he once said in my hearing, " who cannot go
                        behind the dictionaries for his authority."</p>
                    <p>We had a copy of Johnson's dictionary in the office, and it was the only
                        authority of that kind I ever knew Mr. Bryant to consult. Even in consulting
                        that he gave small attention to the formal definitions. He searched at once
                        the passages quoted from classic English literature as illustrations of
                        usage, and if these did not justify the particular locution under
                        consideration, he rejected and condemned it.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-220" n="211"/>
                    <p>For another thing, the <hi rend="i">Index</hi> as it has been quoted for
                        purposes of cheap ridicule, held much that Mr. Bryant did not put into it,
                        and for which he was in no way responsible. The staff of the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post</hi> was composed mainly of educated men, and each of them
                        was free to add to the <hi rend="i">Index</hi> such prohibitions as seemed
                        to him desirable. Some of these represented mere crotchets, but they were
                        all intended to aid in that conservation of English undefiled which was so
                        dear a purpose to Mr. Bryant.</p>
                    <p>In the main the usages condemned by the <hi rend="i">Index</hi> were
                        deserving of condemnation, but in some respects the prohibitions were too
                        strait-laced, too negligent of the fact that a living language grows and
                        that usages unknown to one generation may become altogether good in another.
                        Again some of the prohibitions were founded upon a too strict regard for
                        etymology, in forgetfulness of the fact that words often change or modify
                        and sometimes even reverse their original significance. As an example,
                        Shakespeare uses the expression " fearful adversaries," meaning badly scared
                        adversaries, and that is, of course, the etymological significance of the
                        word. Yet we now universally use it in a precisely opposite sense, meaning
                        that the things called " fearful " are such as fill us with fear.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it is to be said that Mr. Bryant neither intended nor attempted to
                        enforce the <hi rend="i">Index</hi> arbitrarily, or even to impose its
                        restrictions upon any but the least educated and least experienced of the
                        writers who served his newspaper. I used to violate it freely, and one day I
                        mentioned the fact to Mr. Bryant. He replied:</p>
                    <p>"My dear Mr. Eggleston, the <hi rend="i">Index</hi> was never intended to
                        interfere with scholarly men who know how to write good English. It is meant
                        only to restrain the inconsiderate youngsters and start them in right
                        paths."</p>
                    <p>His subordinates were less liberal in their interpretation <pb
                            id="VAA2427-221" n="212"/> of the matter. The man whose duty it was to
                        make clippings from other newspapers to be reprinted in the <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Post</hi>, was expected so to edit and alter them as to bring
                        them within <hi rend="i">Index</hi> requirements, and sometimes the
                        alterations were so considerable as to make of the extracts positive
                        misquotations. I have often wondered that none of the newspapers whose
                        utterances were thus "edited" out of their original forms and still credited
                        to them ever complained of the liberties taken with the text. But so far as
                        I know none of them ever did.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Bryant and I were talking of the <hi rend="i">Index</hi> and of the
                        license I had to violate it judiciously, he smilingly said to me:</p>
                    <p>"After all a misuse of words is sometimes strangely effective. In the old
                        days when I wrote more for the editorial columns than I do now, I had a
                        friend who was deeply interested in all matters of public concern, and whose
                        counsel I valued very highly because of the abounding common sense that
                        always inspired it. His knowledge of our language was defective, but he was
                        unconscious of the fact, and he boldly used words as he understood them,
                        without the smallest fear of criticism before his eyes. Once when some
                        subject of unusual public importance was under popular consideration, I
                        wrote a long and very careful article concerning it. I did my best to set
                        forth every consideration that in any wise bore upon it, and to make clear
                        and emphatic what I regarded as the marrow of the matter. My friend was
                        deeply interested, and came to talk with me on the subject.</p>
                    <p>"'That is a superb article of yours, Mr. Bryant,' he said, 'but it will do no
                        manner of good.' I asked him why, and he answered: 'Because you have
                        exhausted the subject, and won't come back to it. That never accomplishes
                        anything. If you want to produce an effect <pb id="VAA2427-222" n="213"/>
                        you must keep hammering at the thing. I tell you, Mr. Bryant, it is <hi
                            rend="i">reirritation</hi> that does the business.'</p>
                    <p>"I thought the matter over and saw that he was right, not only in his idea
                        but still more in the word he had mistakenly chosen for its expression. In
                        such cases it is not only reiteration, but <hi rend="i">reirritation</hi>
                        that is effective."</p>
                    <p>There are other indexes in other newspaper offices. Those of them that I have
                        seen represent crass ignorance quite as often as scholarship. One of them
                        absolutely forbids the use of the pronoun "which." Another which I saw some
                        years ago, put a ban on the conjunctions "and" and "but." This prohibition,
                        I am informed, was designed to compel the use of short sentencesa very
                        desirable thing, of course, but one which may easily be pushed to extremes.
                        Imagine a reporter having to state that "X and Y were caught in the act of
                        firing a tenement house, and arrested by two policemen, officers A and B,
                        but that X escaped on the way to the station-house after knocking policeman
                        B down and seriously if not fatally injuring him." If the reader will try to
                        make that simple statement without the use of the four "ands" and the one
                        "but" in the sentence, he will have a realizing sense of the difficulty the
                        writers on that newspaper must have had in their efforts to comply with the
                        requirements of the index.</p>
                    <p>In still another case the unscholarly maker of the index, having learned that
                        it is incorrect to say "on to-day," "on yesterday," and "on to-morrow," has
                        made a blanket application of what he has mistaken for a principle, and has
                        decreed that his writers shall not say "on the fourth of March" or "on
                        Wednesday of next week," or anything else of the kind. The ignorance shown
                        in that case is not merely a manifestation of a deficient scholarship; it
                        means that the maker of the index knew so little <pb id="VAA2427-223"
                            n="214"/> of grammar as not to know the difference between an adverb and
                        a noun. Yet every one of the newspapers enforcing these ignorant index
                        requirements has made fun of Mr. Bryant's scholarly prohibitions.</p>
                    <p>Reserved, dignified, self-conscious as he was, Mr. Bryant was always a
                        democrat of the proud old conservative sort. He never descended to undue
                        familiarity with anybody. He patted nobody on the back, and I have never
                        been able to imagine what would have happened if anybody had taken familiar
                        liberties of that kind with him. Certainly nobody ever ventured to find out
                        by practical experiment. He never called even the youngest man on his staff
                        by his given name or by his surname without the prefix "Mr."</p>
                    <p>In that respect he differed radically and, to my mind, pleasingly from
                        another distinguished democrat.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Cleveland was for the third time a candidate for the Presidency, I
                        called on him by Mr. Pulitzer's request just before sailing for Paris, where
                        Mr. Pulitzer was then living. I entered the reception room at his hotel
                        quarters and sent in my card. Mr. Cleveland came out promptly and greeted me
                        with the exclamation:</p>
                    <p>"Why, hello, Eggleston! How are you? I'm glad to see you."</p>
                    <p>There was no harm in it, I suppose, but it disagreeably impressed me as the
                        greeting of a politician rather than that of a distinguished statesman who
                        had been President of the United States and hoped to be so again. Had I been
                        an intimate personal friend who could say "Hello, Cleveland!" in response, I
                        should have accepted his greeting as a manifestation of cordiality and
                        good-fellowship. I was in fact only slightly acquainted with him, and in
                        view of all the circumstances his familiarity of address impressed me as
                        boorish. Years afterwards I learned how easy it was for him to do boorish
                        thingshow much <pb id="VAA2427-224" n="215"/> restraint, indeed, he found it
                        necessary to impose upon himself in order to avoid the doing of boorish
                        things.</p>
                    <p>But while Mr. Bryant never indulged in undue familiarity with anybody, he
                        never lost sight of the dignity of those with whom he conversed, and above
                        all, he never suffered shams to obscure his perception of realities. One
                        Sunday at his home in Roslyn he told me the story of his abrupt leaving of
                        England during a journey to Europe. I will tell it here as nearly as
                        possible in his own words.</p>
                    <p>"English society," he said, "is founded upon shams, falsehoods, and arrogant
                        pretenses, and the falsehoods are in many ways insulting not only to the
                        persons whom they directly affect, but to the intelligence and manhood of
                        the casual observer who happens to have an honest and sincere mind. When I
                        was over there I was for a time the guest of a wealthy manufacturer, a man
                        of education, refinement, and culture, whose house in the country was an
                        altogether delightful place to visit and whose personality I found unusually
                        pleasing. One day as he and I were walking through his grounds a man came up
                        on horseback and my host introduced us. It seems he was the head of one of
                        the great 'county families,' as they call themselves and are called by
                        others. He explained that he was on his way to my host's house to call upon
                        me, wherefore we turned back in his company. During the call he asked me to
                        be his guest at dinner on a day named, and I accepted, he saying that he
                        would have a number of 'the best county people' to meet me. As the evening
                        of the dinner day approached, I asked my host: 'When shall we dress for the
                        dinner?' He looked at his watch and replied: 'It is time for <hi rend="i"
                            >you</hi> to begin dressing now.' I observed the stress he laid upon the
                        word 'you' and asked: 'Isn't it time for you, also?'</p>
                    <p>"'Oh, I am not invited,' he replied.</p>
                    <p>"'Not invited? Why, what can you mean?' I asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-225" n="216"/>
                    <p>"'Why, of course I'm not invited. Those are county people and I am only a
                        manufacturera man in trade. They would never think of inviting me to
                        dinner.'</p>
                    <p>"I was surprised and shocked.</p>
                    <p>"'Do you mean to tell me,' I asked, 'that that man came into your house where
                        I am a guest, and invited me to dinner, to meet his friends, without
                        including you, my host, in the invitation?'</p>
                    <p>"'Why, yes, of course,' he replied. 'You must remember that they are county
                        families, aristocrats, while I am a man in trade. They would not think of
                        inviting me, and I should never expect it.'</p>
                    <p>"I was full of disgust and indignation. I asked my host to let one of his
                        servants carry a note for me to the great man's house.</p>
                    <p>"'But why?' he asked. 'You will be going over there yourself within the
                        hour.'</p>
                    <p>"'I am not going,' I replied. 'I will not be a party to so gross an affront
                        to my host. I shall send a note, not of apology out of unexplained
                        declination.'</p>
                    <p>"I did so, and as soon thereafter as I could arrange it, I quitted England in
                        disgust with a social system so false, so arbitrary, and so arrogant that
                        one may not even behave like a gentleman without transgressing its most
                        insistent rules of social exclusiveness.</p>
                    <p>"The worst of the matter was the meek submissiveness of my host to the
                        affront put upon him. He was shocked and distressed that I should decline to
                        go to the dinner. He could not understand that the smallest slight had been
                        put upon him, and I could not make him understand it. That showed how
                        completely saturated the English mind is with the virus of arbitrary caste.
                        I am told that there has been some amelioration of all this during recent
                        years. I do not know how much it amounts to. But did you ever hear an
                        English <hi rend="i">grande dame</hi> crush the life out of <pb
                            id="VAA2427-226" n="217"/> a sweet and innocent young girl by calling
                        her 'that young person'? If not, you cannot imagine what measureless
                        contempt can be put into a phrase, or how much of cruelty and injustice may
                        be wrought by the utterance of three words."</p>

                    <p>D<hi rend="sc">URING</hi> my service as a literary editor, I held firmly to
                        the conviction that the function of the newspaper book reviewer is
                        essentially a news function; that it is not his business to instruct other
                        people as to how they should write, or to tell them how they ought to have
                        written, but rather to tell readers what they have written and how; to show
                        forth the character of each book reviewed in such fashion that the reader
                        shall be able to decide for himself whether or not he wishes to buy and read
                        it, and that in the main this should be done in a helpful and generously
                        appreciative spirit, and never carpingly, with intent to show the smartness
                        of the reviewera cheap thing at best. The space allotted to book reviews in
                        any newspaper is at best wholly insufficient for anything like adequate
                        criticism, and very generally the reviewer is a person imperfectly equipped
                        for the writing of such criticism.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with this conception of my functions, I always held the news
                        idea in mind. I was alert to secure advance sheets of important books, in
                        order that the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> might be the first of
                        newspapers to tell readers about them.</p>
                    <p>Usually the publishers were ready and eager to give the <hi rend="i">Evening
                            Post</hi> these opportunities, though the literary editors of some
                        morning newspapers bitterly complained of what they regarded as favoritism
                        when I was able to anticipate them. On one very notable occasion, however,
                        great pains were taken by the publishers to avoid all <pb id="VAA2427-227"
                            n="218"/> grounds of complaint. When Tennyson's "Harold" was published
                        in 1876, there had been no previous announcement of its coming. The greatest
                        secrecy, indeed, had been maintained. Neither in England nor in America had
                        any hint been given that any poem by Tennyson was presently forthcoming. On
                        the day of publication, precisely at noon, copies of "Harold" were laid upon
                        the desks of all the literary editors in England and America.</p>
                    <p>My book reviews for that day were already in type and in the forms. One hour
                        later the first edition of the paperthe latest into which book reviews could
                        gomust go to press. I knew that my good friends, the literary editors of the
                        morning newspapers, would exploit this great literary news the next morning,
                        and that the evening papers would have it in the afternoon following. I
                        resolved to be ahead of all of them.</p>
                    <p>I hurriedly sent for the foreman of the composing room and enlisted his
                        coperation. With the aid of my scissors I got two columns of matter ready,
                        consisting mainly of quotations hastily clipped from the book, with a
                        connective tissue of comment, and with an introductory paragraph or two
                        giving the first news of the publication of an important and very ambitious
                        dramatic poem by Tennyson.</p>
                    <p>At one o'clock the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> went to press with this
                        literary "beat" displayed upon its first page. It proved to be the first
                        announcement of the poem's publication either in England or in America, and
                        it appeared twelve or fifteen hours in advance of any other publication
                        either by advertisement or otherwise.</p>
                    <p>On that occasion I tried to draw from Mr. Bryant some expression of opinion
                        regarding Tennyson's work and the place he would probably occupy among
                        English poets when the last word should be said concerning him. I thought to
                        use the new poem and a certain coincidence <pb id="VAA2427-228" n="219"/>
                        connected with itpresently to be mentionedas a means of drawing some
                        utterance of opinion from him. It was of no avail. In reply to my
                        questioning, Mr. Bryant said:</p>
                    <p>"It is too soon to assign Tennyson to his permanent place in literature. He
                        may yet do things greater than any that he has done. And besides, we are too
                        near to judge his work, except tentatively. You remember Solon's dictum'Call
                        no man happy until death.' It is especially unsafe to attempt a final
                        judgment upon the works of a poet while the glamor of them is still upon us.
                        Moreover, I have never been a critic. I should distrust any critical
                        judgment of my own."</p>
                    <p>That reminded me that I had never heard Mr. Bryant express his opinion with
                        regard to the work of any modern poet, living or dead. The nearest approach
                        to anything of the kind that I can recall was in a little talk I had with
                        him when I was about leaving for Boston to attend the breakfast given in
                        celebration of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes's seventieth year. The subject of
                        Holmes's work arose naturally, and in talking of it Mr. Bryant said:</p>
                    <p>"After all, it is as a novelist chiefly that I think of him."</p>
                    <p>"You are thinking of 'Elsie Venner'?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"No,of 'The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,'" he answered. "Few persons care
                        for anything in that except the witty wisdom of it, and I suppose Dr. Holmes
                        wrote it for the sake of that. But there is a sweet love story in the
                        bookhidden like a bird in a clump of obtrusively flowering bushes. It is a
                        sweet, wholesome story, and the heroine of it is a very natural and very
                        lovable young woman."</p>
                    <p>The coincidence referred to above was this. Almost exactly at the time of the
                        publication of Tennyson's "Harold," some American whose name I have
                        forgotten, to <pb id="VAA2427-229" n="220"/> my regret, brought out a
                        dramatic poem on the same subject, with the same hero, and in a closely
                        similar form. It was entitled "The Son of Godwin," and, unless my memory
                        plays me a trick, it was a work of no little merit. It was completely
                        overshadowed, of course, by Tennyson's greater performance, but it had
                        enough of virility and poetic quality in it to tempt me to write a carefully
                        studied comparison of the two works.</p>
                    <p>While Mr. Bryant shrank from the delivery of opinions concerning the moderns,
                        his judgments of the older writers of English literature were fully formed
                        and very positive. He knew the classic literature of our languageand
                        especially its poetic literaturemore minutely, more critically, and more
                        appreciatively than any other person I have ever known, and he often talked
                        instructively and inspiringly on the subject.</p>
                    <p>On one of those periodically recurring occasions when the Baconian authorship
                        of Shakespeare's works is clamorously contended for by ill-balanced
                        enthusiasts, Mr. Bryant asked me if I had it in mind to write anything about
                        the controversy. I told him I had not, unless he particularly wished me to
                        do so.</p>
                    <p>"On the contrary," he answered; "I particularly wish otherwise. It is a sheer
                        waste of good brain tissue to argue with persons who, having read anything
                        avowedly written by Bacon, are still able to persuade themselves that the
                        least poetical and most undramatic of writers could have written the most
                        poetical and most dramatic works that exist in any language."</p>
                    <p>"It seems to me," I answered, "that the trouble with such persons is that
                        they are futilely bothering their brains in an attempt to account for the
                        unaccountable. Shakespeare was a genius, and genius is a thing that can in
                        nowise be measured, or weighed, or accounted for, while genius itself
                        accounts for anything and everything <pb id="VAA2427-230" n="221"/> it may
                        do. It is subject to no restrictions, amenable to no law, and restrained by
                        no limitations whatsoever."</p>
                    <p>"That is an excellent way of putting an obvious truth," he answered. "I wish
                        you would write it down precisely as you have uttered it orally, and print
                        it as the <hi rend="i">Evening Post's</hi> sole comment upon the
                        controversy."</p>
                    <p>Then he sat musing for a time, and after a while added:</p>
                    <p>"Genius exists in varying degrees in different men. In Shakespeare it was
                        supreme, all-inspiring, all-controlling. In lesser men it manifests itself
                        less conspicuously and less constantly, but not less positively. No other
                        poet who ever lived could have written Coleridge's 'The Rime of the Ancient
                        Mariner,' yet Coleridge could no more have written 'Hamlet' or 'Macbeth' or
                        'The Merry Wives of Windsor' than any child in pinafores could. When poetry
                        is genuine, it is inspired, as truly as any sacred Scripture ever was.
                        Without inspiration there may be cleverness, beauty, and grandeur in
                        metrical composition, but genuine poetry is the result of inspiration
                        always, and inspiration is genius."</p>
                    <p>"Whence comes the inspiration?" I ventured to ask, hoping to draw something
                        further from him.</p>
                    <p>"I do not know," he answered. "Whence comes the color of the rose or the
                        violet or the dandelion? I am not a theologian, to dogmatize about things
                        that are beyond the ken of human intelligence. I only know that the
                        inspiration is there, just as I know that the colors of the flowers are
                        therein both cases because the thing perceived is obvious."</p>
                    <p>One day I asked Mr. Bryant about "Thanatopsis." When I made my first
                        acquaintance with that poem in a school reader, it was printed with some
                        introductory lines in smaller type, and I had never been able to discover
                        the relation of those lines to the poem or to the thought that inspired
                        it.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-231" n="222"/>
                    <p>In answer to my questions Mr. Bryant explained that the lines in question
                        really had no relation to the poem and no possible connection with it.</p>
                    <p>"I was a mere boy," he said, "when 'Thanatopsis' was written. It bore no
                        title in my manuscriptthat was supplied by an editor who knew Greek, a
                        language of which I did not then know even the alphabet. My father got
                        possession of the poem, took it to Boston, and had it published, all without
                        my knowledge. With the manuscript of it he found some other lines of mine
                        and assumed that they belonged to the poem, as they did not. The editor
                        printed them at top in smaller type, and they got into the schoolbooks in
                        that way. That is the whole story."</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>LIV</head>
                    <p>D<hi rend="sc">URING</hi> my service on the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi>, I
                        made a curious blunder which circumstances rendered it necessary for others
                        to exploit. The thing grievously annoyed me at the time, but later it only
                        amused me as an illustration of a psychological principle.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Richard Grant White, writing in some newspaper or magazine in opposition
                        to the proposed adoption of the metric system of weights and measures, had
                        made an amusing blunder. He wrote that the old system was so fixed in men's
                        minds as to admit of no possible mistake. He added something like this:</p>
                    <p>"Nobody has any difficulty in remembering that two gills make one pint, two
                        pints one quart, four quarts one gallon, etc."</p>
                    <p>I cannot pretend to quote his utterance exactly, but that is the substance of
                        it, the marrow of the matter being that in the very act of showing that
                        nobody could have <pb id="VAA2427-232" n="223"/> the least trouble in
                        remembering the table of liquid measure, he himself got it wrong.</p>
                    <p>The derisive comments of all the newspapers upon his blunder may be easily
                        imagined. For reply he invented a word of Greek derivation, "heterophemy."
                        He contended that it was a common thing for one to speak or write one thing
                        when quite another thing was in his mind, and when the speaker or writer
                        perfectly knew the thing he sought to say. He explained that when the mind
                        has once slipped into an error of that kind it is usually unable, or at
                        least unlikely, to detect it in the revision of proofs, or in any other
                        survey of the utterance. His exposition was very learned, very ingenious,
                        and very interesting, but it had no effect in silencing the newspaper wags,
                        who at once adopted his newly-coined word, "heterophemy," and made it the
                        butt of many jests.</p>
                    <p>About that time Mr. Alexander H. Stephens published in one of the more
                        dignified periodicals of the timethe <hi rend="i">North American
                        Review</hi>, perhapsa very learned essay in which he sought to fix the
                        authorship of the letters of Junius upon Sir Philip Francis. Mr. Stephens
                        brought to the discussion a ripe scholarship and a deal of fresh and
                        original thought that gave importance to his paper, and I reviewed it in the
                            <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> as carefully and as fully as if it had
                        been a book.</p>
                    <p>I was deeply concerned to have my review of so important a paper in all
                        respects the best I could make it, and to that end I read my proofs twice,
                        with minute attention, as I thought, to every detail.</p>
                    <p>The next day, if I remember correctly, was Sunday. At any rate, it was a day
                        on which I remained at home. When I opened my morning newspapers, the first
                        thing that attracted my attention was a letter in one of them from Richard
                        Grant White, of which my article was the subject. Here, he said, was a
                        conspicuous and unmistakable <pb id="VAA2427-233" n="224"/> example of
                        heterophemy, which could not be attributed to ignorance or inattention or
                        anything else, except precisely that tendency of the human mind which he had
                        set forth as the source of mistakes otherwise unaccountable. He went on to
                        say that mine was an article founded upon adequate scholarship and evidently
                        written with unusual care; that its writer obviously knew his subject and
                        had written of it with the utmost attention to accuracy of statement in
                        every detail; that he had evidently read his proofs carefully as not a slip
                        appeared in the printed copy of the article, not even so much as a
                        typographical error; and yet that in two or three instances this careful
                        critic had written "Sir Philip Sidney" instead of "Sir Philip Francis." He
                        pointed out that these slips could not have been due to any possible
                        confusion in my mind of two Sir Philips who lived two hundred years apart,
                        chronologically, and whose careers were as wholly unlike as it was possible
                        to conceive; for, he pointed out, my article itself bore ample witness to my
                        familiarity with Sir Philip Francis's history. Here, Mr. White insisted, was
                        the clearest possible case of heterophemy, untainted by even a possible
                        suspicion of ignorance or confusion of mind. Further, he urged, the case
                        illustrated and confirmed his contention that, having written a word or name
                        or phrase not intended, the writer is extremely unlikely to discover the
                        slip even in the most careful reading of proofs. For in this case every
                        appearance indicated a careful proofreading on the part of the author of the
                        article.</p>
                    <p>When I read Mr. White's letter I simply could not believe that I had made the
                        slips he attributed to me. Certainly there was no confusion in my mind of
                        Sir Philip Francis with Sir Philip Sidney. I was familiar with the very
                        different histories of the two altogether dissimilar men, and it seemed
                        inconceivable to me that I had written <pb id="VAA2427-234" n="225"/> the
                        name of the one for that of the other even once in an article in which the
                        right name was written perhaps a dozen times.</p>
                    <p>It was a troubled and unhappy "day off" for me. I had no copy of the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post</hi> of the preceding day in the house, and a
                        diligent inquiry at all the news-stands in the remote quarter of Brooklyn in
                        which I then lived, failed to discover one. But as I thought of the matter
                        in troubled fashion, I became more and more convinced that Mr. White had
                        misread what I had written, in which case I anticipated a good deal of fun
                        in exposing and exploiting his error. As the day waned I became positively
                        certain in my mind that no such mistake had been made, that no mention of
                        Sir Philip Sidney could by any possibility have crept into my article
                        concerning Sir Philip Francis.</p>
                    <p>But when I arrived at the office of the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> next
                        morning, I found the facts to be as Mr. White had represented them. I had
                        written "Sir Philip Francis" throughout the article, except in two or three
                        places, where the name appeared as "Sir Philip Sidney." I was so incredulous
                        of the blunder that I went to the composing room and secured my manuscript.
                        The error was there in the written copy. I asked the chief proofreader why
                        he had not observed and queried it in view of the fact that my use of the
                        name had been correct in most instances, but he was unable to offer any
                        explanation except that his mind had accepted the one name for the other.
                        The foreman of the composing room, a man of education and large literary
                        knowledge, had read the proofs merely as a matter of interest, but he had
                        not observed the error. I had no choice but to accept Mr. Richard Grant
                        White's interpretation of the matter and call it a case of heterophemy.</p>
                    <p>There are blunders made that are not so easily accounted <pb id="VAA2427-235"
                            n="226"/> for. A leading New York newspaper once complained of Mr.
                        Cleveland's veto messages as tiresome and impertinent, and asked why he
                        persisted in setting forth his reasons for disapproving acts of Congress,
                        instead of sending them back disapproved without reasons.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> found it necessary to direct the
                        newspaper's attention to the fact that the Constitution of the United States
                        expressly requires the President, in vetoing a measure, to set forth his
                        reasons for doing so. In a like forgetfulness of Constitutional provisions
                        for safeguarding the citizen, the same newspaper complained of the police,
                        when Tweed escaped and went into hiding, for not searching every house in
                        New York till the malefactor should be found. It was Parke Godwin who cited
                        the Constitution in answer to that manifestation of ignorance, and he did it
                        with the strong hand of a master to whom forgetfulness of the fundamental
                        law seemed not only inexcusable, on the part of a newspaper writer, but
                        dangerous to liberty as well.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the worst case I ever knew of ignorance assuming the critical
                        functions of expert knowledge, was one which occurred some years later.
                        William Hamilton Gibson published a superbly illustrated work, which won
                        commendation everywhere for the exquisite perfection of the drawings, both
                        in gross and in minute detail. A certain art critic who had made a good deal
                        of noise in the world by his assaults upon the integrity of art treasures in
                        the Metropolitan Museum, assailed Gibson's work in print. Finding nothing in
                        the illustrations that he could criticise, he accused Gibson of sailing
                        under false colors and claiming credit for results that were not of his
                        creation. He said that nearly everything of value in the illustrations of
                        Gibson's book was the work not of the artist but of the engraver who, he
                        declared, had "added <pb id="VAA2427-236" n="227"/> increment after
                        increment of value" to the crude original drawings.</p>
                    <p>In a brief letter to the newspaper which had printed this destructive
                        criticism without its writer's name appended to it, Mr. Gibson had only to
                        direct attention to the fact that the pictures in question were not
                        engravings at all, but slavish photographic reproductions of his original
                        drawings, and that no engraver had had anything whatever to do with
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The criticism to which so conclusive a reply was possible was anonymous, and
                        its author never acknowledged or in any way sought to atone for the wanton
                        wrong he had sought to inflict under cover of anonymity. But his agency in
                        the matter was known to persons "on the inside" of literature, art, and
                        journalism, and the shame of his deed rankled in the minds of honest men. He
                        wrote little if anything after that, and the reputation he had made faded
                        out of men's memory.</p>

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> Mr. Bryant died, Mr. Parke Godwin assumed editorial
                        control of the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi>, and his attention promptly
                        wrought something like a miracle in the increased vigor and aggressiveness
                        of its editorial conduct. Mr. Godwin was well advanced in middle life at
                        that time; he was comfortably provided with this world's goods, and he was
                        not anxious to take up again the strenuous journalistic work in which he had
                        already achieved all there was to achieve of reputation. But in his own
                        interest and in the interest of Mr. Bryant's heirs, it seemed necessary for
                        him to step into this breach. Moreover, he had abated none of his interest
                        in public affairs or in those things that make for culture, enlightenment,
                            <pb id="VAA2427-237" n="228"/> and human betterment. He had never ceased
                        to write for the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> upon matters of such kind
                        when occasion called for strong, virile utterance.</p>
                    <p>In his declining years Mr. Bryant had not lost interest in these things, but
                        he had abated somewhat his activity with reference to them. He had more and
                        more left the conduct of the newspaper to his subordinates, trusting to what
                        he used to call his "volunteer staff"Parke Godwin, John Bigelow, Samuel J.
                        Tilden, and other strong men, to furnish voluntarily all that was needed of
                        strenuosity in the discussion of matters closely concerning the public weal.
                        I do not know that Mr. Tilden was ever known to the public even as an
                        occasional writer for the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi>. He was a man of
                        singularly secretive temperament, and when he wrote anything for the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post</hi> its anonymity was guarded with a jealousy
                        such as I have never known any other person to exercise. What he wroteon the
                        infrequent occasions of his writing at allwas given to Mr. Bryant and by him
                        handed in with instructions for its publication and without a hint to
                        anybody concerning its authorship. It was only by accident that I learned
                        whence certain articles came, and I think that knowledge was not usually
                        shared with any other member of Mr. Bryant's staff.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Godwin pursued a different course. These occasional contributions did not
                        satisfy his ideas of what the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> should be in
                        its editorial utterances. He set to work to stimulate a greater
                        aggressiveness on the part of the staff writers, and he himself brought a
                        strong hand to bear upon the work.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Godwin died, a few years ago, Dr. Titus Munson Coan, in an obituary
                        sketch read before the Authors Club, said with reference to this part of his
                        career that in the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> office "he was a lion in a
                        den of Daniels," and the figure of speech was altogether apt.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-238" n="229"/>
                    <p>He had gifts of an uncommon sort. He knew how to say strong things in a
                        strong way. He could wield the rapier of subtle sarcasm, and the bludgeon of
                        denunciation with an equally skilled hand. Sometimes he brought even a
                        trip-hammer into play with startling effect.</p>
                    <p>I remember one conspicuous case of the kind. Sara Bernhardt was playing one
                        of her earliest and most brilliant engagements in New York. Mr. Godwin's
                        alert interest in every form of high art led him not only to employ critics
                        of specially expert quality to write of her work, but himself now and then
                        to write something of more than ordinary appreciation of the great
                        French-woman's genius as illustrated in her performance.</p>
                    <p>Presently a certain clergyman of the "sensational" school, who had denounced
                        the theater as "the door of hell and the open gateway of damnation," sent to
                        the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> an intemperate protest against the large
                        space it was giving to Sara Bernhardt and her art. The letter was entitled
                        "Quite Enough of Sara Bernhardt," and in the course of it the writer
                        declared the great actress to be a woman of immoral character and dissolute
                        life, whom it was a shame, a disgrace, and a public calamity for the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post</hi> even to name in its columns.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Godwin wrote an answer to the tirade. He entitled it "Quite Enough of
                        X"the "X" standing here for the clergyman's name, which he used in full. It
                        was one of the most effective bits of criticism and destructive analysis I
                        ever saw in print, and it left the critic of Sara Bernhardt with not a leg
                        to stand upon, and with no possibility of reply. Mr. Godwin pointed out that
                        Sara Bernhardt had asked American attention, not as a woman, but solely as
                        an artist; that it was of her art alone, and not of her personality that the
                            <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> had written; that she had neither asked
                        admission to American society nor accepted it when pressed upon her; <pb
                            id="VAA2427-239" n="230"/> and that her personal character and mode of
                        life had no more to do with the duty of considering her art than had the
                        sins of any old master when one viewed his paintings and sought to interpret
                        the genius that inspired them.</p>
                    <p>So far Mr. Godwin was argumentative and placative. But he had other arrows in
                        his quiver. He challenged the clergyman to say how he knew that the actress
                        was a person of immoral character and dissolute life, and to explain what
                        right he had to make charges of that kind against a woman without the
                        smallest evidence of their truth. And so on to the end of a chapter that
                        must have been very bitter reading to the offender if he had been a person
                        of normal sensitiveness, as he was not.</p>
                    <p>I have cited this occurrence merely by way of explaining the fact that Mr.
                        Godwin had many critics and many enemies. A man of sincere mind and
                        aggressive temper upon proper occasion, and especially one possessed of his
                        giit of vigorous expression, must needs make enemies in plenty, if he edits
                        a newspaper or otherwise writes for publication. But on the other hand,
                        those who knew him best were all and always his devoted friendsthose who
                        knew his sturdy character, his unflinching honesty of mind, and his sincere
                        devotion to the right as he saw it.</p>
                    <p>My acquaintance with him, before his assumption of control on the <hi
                            rend="i">Evening Post,</hi> was comparatively slight, and in all that I
                        here write of his character and mind, I am drawing upon my recollection of
                        him during a later intimacy which, beginning on the <hi rend="i">Evening
                            Post,</hi> was drawn closer during my service on another newspaper, and
                        endured until his death.</p>
                    <p>After a brief period of editorship Mr. Godwin sold a controlling interest in
                        the <hi rend="i">Evening Post</hi> to a company of men represented by
                        Messrs. Horace White, E. L. Godkin, and Carl SchurzMr. Schurz becoming the
                        titular editor for a time. When Mr. Godwin learned, after the <pb
                            id="VAA2427-240" n="231"/> sale was agreed upon, that Mr. Godkin was one
                        of the incoming group, he sought to buy Mr. Godkin's weekly newspaper, <hi
                            rend="i">The Nation</hi>, and as the negotiation seemed for a time to
                        promise well, he arranged to make me editor of that periodical. This opened
                        to me a prospect of congenial work, more agreeable to me than any that a
                        daily newspaper could offer. But in the end Mr. Godkin declined to sell the
                            <hi rend="i">Nation</hi> at any price that Mr. Godwin thought fair, and
                        made it instead the weekly edition of the <hi rend="i">Evening
                        Post</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I again quitted the newspaper life, fully intending to enter it
                        no more. Literary work of many kinds was open to me, and it was my purpose
                        to devote myself exclusively to it, maintaining a literary workshop in my
                        own home. I became an adviser of the Harper publishing house, with no office
                        attendance required of me, no working time fixed, and no interference of any
                        kind with my entire liberty. I was writing now and then for the editorial
                        pages of the great newspapers, regularly for a number of magazines, and
                        occasionally writing a book, though that was infrequent for the reason that
                        in the absence of international copyright, there was no encouragement to
                        American authors to write books in competition with reprints that cost their
                        publishers nothing.</p>
                    <p>In mentioning this matter of so-called "piracy," I do not mean to accuse the
                        reputable American publishers of English books of any wrong, for they were
                        guilty of none. They were victims of the lack of law as truly as the authors
                        on either side were. They were as eager as the authorsEnglish or
                        Americancould be, for an international copyright law. For lack of it their
                        profits were cut short and their business enterprises set awry. The
                        reputable publishing houses in this country actually purchased the American
                        publishing rights of many English books with no other protection of what
                        they had <pb id="VAA2427-241" n="232"/> purchased than such as was afforded
                        by the "courtesy of the trade"a certain gentlemen's agreement under which no
                        reputable American publisher would reprint a book of which another publisher
                        had bought the advance sheets. This protection was uncertain, meager, and
                        often ineffective for the reason that there were disreputable publishers in
                        plenty who paid no heed to the "courtesy of the trade" but reprinted
                        whatsoever they thought would sell.</p>
                    <p>In the case of such works as those of Herbert Spencer and some others, I
                        believe I am correctly informed that the American publishers paid larger
                        royalties to the authorslarger in gross amount, at leastthan those authors
                        received from their English publishers. In the same way American publishers
                        of the better class paid liberally for advance sheets of the best foreign
                        fiction, often at heavy loss to themselves because the books they had bought
                        were promptly reprinted in very cheap form by their less scrupulous
                        competitors. In the case of fiction of a less distinguished kind, of which
                        no advance sheets were offered, they had no choice but to make cheap
                        reprints on their own account.</p>
                    <p>It is proper to say also that if this was "piracy," the American publishers
                        were by no means the worst pirates or the most conspicuous ones, though the
                        complaints made were chiefly of English origin and were all directed against
                        the Americans.</p>
                    <p>I shall never forget the way in which my brother, Edward Egglestonhimself an
                        active worker for international copyrightmet the complaints of one English
                        critic who was more lavish and less discriminative in his criticism in a
                        company of Americans than Edward thought good manners justified. The critic
                        was the son of an English poet, whose father's chief work had won
                        considerable popularity in America. The young man was a guest at one of the
                        receptions of the Authors Club, every <pb id="VAA2427-242" n="233"/> member
                        of which was directly or indirectly a sufferer by reason of the lack of
                        international copyright. He seized upon the occasion for the delivery of a
                        tirade against the American dishonesty which, he said, threatened to cut
                        short his travel year by depriving his father of the money justly due him as
                        royalty on the American reprints of his books.</p>
                    <p>My brother listened in silence for a time. Then that pinch of gunpowder that
                        lies somewhere in every human make-up "went off."</p>
                    <p>"The American publishers of your father's poem," he said, "have paid him all
                        they could afford to pay in the present state of the law, I believe?"</p>
                    <p>"Yesbut what is it? A mere fraction of what they justly owe him," the young
                        man answered.</p>
                    <p>"Now listen," said Edward. "You call that American piracy, and you overlook
                        the piracy on the other side. Your father's book has sold so many thousand
                        copies in America"giving the figures. "The English reprint of my 'Hoosier
                        Schoolmaster' has sold nearly ten times that number, according to the
                        figures of the English 'pirates' who reprinted it and who graciously sent me
                        a 'tip,' as I call it, of one hundred dollarsless than a fraction, if I may
                        so call it, of what American publishers have voluntarily paid your father.
                        But dropping that smaller side of the matter, let me tell you that every man
                        in this company is a far greater sufferer from the barbaric state of the law
                        than your father or any other English author ever was. We are denied the
                        opportunity to practise our profession, except under a paralyzing
                        competition with stolen goods. What chance has an American novel, published
                        at a dollar or more, in competition with English fiction even of an inferior
                        sort published at ten cents? We cannot expect the reader who reads only for

                        half for an American novel when he can fill his satchel with reprints of
                        English novels at ten cents apiece. But that is the very smallest part of
                        our loss. The whole American people are inestimably losers because of this
                        thing. They are deprived of all chance of a national literature, reflecting
                        the life of our country, its ideas, its inspirations, and its aspirations.
                        You Englishmen are petty losers in comparison with us. Your losses are
                        measurable in pounds, shillings, and pence. Ours involve things of
                        immeasurably greater value."</p>
                    <p>I have quoted here, as accurately as memory permits, an utterance that met
                        the approval of every author present, because I think that in our appeals to
                        Congress for international copyright only the smaller, lower, and less
                        worthy commercial aspects of the matter have been presented, and that as a
                        consequence the American people have been themselves seriously and hurtfully
                        misled as to the higher importance of a question involving popular interests
                        of far more consequence than the financial returns of authorship can ever
                        be.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> connection with my work for the Harpers it fell to my
                        lot to revise and edit a good many books. Among these were such books of
                        reference as Hayden's Dictionary of Dates, which I twice edited for American
                        readers, putting in the dates of important American affairs, and, more
                        importantly, correcting English misinterpretations of American happenings.
                        For example, under the title "New York" I found an entry, "Fall of O'Kelly,"
                        with a date assigned. The thing probably referred to John Kelly, but the
                        event recorded, with its date, had never occurred within the knowledge of
                        any American. There <pb id="VAA2427-244" n="235"/> were many other such
                        things to cut out and many important matters to put in, and the Harpers paid
                        me liberallyafter their fashion in dealing with men of lettersfor doing the
                        work. In the course of it I had to spend a considerable amount of their
                        money in securing the exact information desired. In one case I applied by
                        letter to one of the executive departments at Washington for exact
                        information concerning a certain document. For answer I received a letter,
                        written by a clerk, doubtless, but signed by a chief of bureau, embodying a
                        copy of the document. In that copy I found a line thrice repeated, and I was
                        unable to make out whether the repetition was in the original or was the
                        work of a copying clerk asleep at his post. I wrote to inquire, but the
                        chief of bureau replied that he had no authority to find out, wherefore I
                        had to make a journey to Washington at the expense of Harper and Brothers,
                        to ascertain the facts. I came out of that expedition with the conviction,
                        which still lingers in my mind, that the system that gives civil service
                        employees a tenure of office with which their chiefs have no power to
                        interfere by peremptory discharge for inefficiency or misconduct, as the
                        managing men of every successful business enterprise may do, is vicious in
                        principle and bad in outcome.</p>
                    <p>That and other experiences in dealing with executive departments at
                        Washington have made an old fogy of me, I suppose. At any rate they have
                        convinced me that the government's business could and would be better done
                        by half the force now employed, if that half force worked under a
                        consciousness of direct responsibility, each man to an immediate chief who
                        could discharge him for incompetency or inattention. Furthermore, my
                        experience with clerks in the departments at Washington convinces me that
                        the method of selection and promotion by competitive examination, results
                        almost uniformly in the appointment <pb id="VAA2427-245" n="236"/> and in
                        the promotion of inferior and often incompetent men. Certainly no great
                        bank, no great business enterprise of any kind would ever consent to such a
                        method of selecting or promoting its employeesa method which excludes from
                        consideration the knowledge every chief of bureau or department must
                        necessarily have of the qualifications of his subordinates. The clerk who
                        repeated that line three times in making an official transcript of an
                        official document had been for several years in the public service, and I
                        suppose he is there yet, if he isn't dead. How long would a bookkeeper in a
                        bank hold his place after making a similar blunder? But then, banks are
                        charged with an obligation to remain solvent, and must appoint and discharge
                        employees with due reference to that necessity. The government is not
                        subject to that requirement, and it recognizes a certain obligation to heed
                        the vagaries of the theorists who regard themselves as commissioneddivinely
                        or otherwiseto reform the world in accordance with the suggestions of their
                        own inner consciousness and altogether without regard to the practical
                        experience of humankind.</p>
                    <p>Mainly, however, the books I was employed to edit were those written by men
                        whose connection with affairs of consequence rendered their utterances
                        important, but whose literary qualifications were small. When such works
                        were presented to the Harpers, it was their practice to accept the books on
                        condition that the authors of them should pay for such editing as was
                        necessary, by some person of literary experience to be selected by the
                        Harpers themselves.</p>
                    <p>In every such case, where I was asked to be the editor and see the book
                        through the press, I stipulated that I was to make no effort to improve
                        literary style, but was to confine myself to seeing that the English was
                        correctwhether elegant or otherwiseand that the book as it <pb
                            id="VAA2427-246" n="237"/> came from the hands of its author should be
                        presented with as little editorial alteration as was possible. I assumed the
                        function of correcting errors and offering advice, not of writing the books
                        anew or otherwise putting them into the literary form I thought they should
                        have. Even with this limitation of function, I found plenty of work to do in
                        every case.</p>
                    <p>It was under a contract of this kind that I undertook to see through the
                        press the volumes published under the title of "The Military Operations of
                        General Beauregard in the War between the States."</p>
                    <p>The work bore the name of Colonel Alfred Roman, as its author, but on every
                        page of it there was conclusive evidence of its direct and minute
                        inspiration by General Beauregard himself. It was with him rather than with
                        Colonel Roman that negotiations were had respecting my editorial work on the
                        book. He was excessively nervous lest I should make alterations of
                        substance, a point on which I was the better able to reassure him because of
                        the fact that my compensation was a sum certain and in no way dependent upon
                        the amount of time or labor I should give to the work. I succeeded in
                        convincing him that I was exceedingly unlikely to undertake more of revision
                        than the contract called for and as one man with another, I assured him that
                        I would make no alteration of substantial consequence in the work without
                        his approval.</p>
                    <p>In editing the book I made a discovery which, I think, is of some historical
                        interest. Throughout the war there was something like a standing quarrel
                        between General Beauregard and Mr. Jefferson Davis, emphasized by the
                        antagonism of Mr. Davis's chief adviser, Judah P. Benjamin to General
                        Beauregard. Into the merits of that quarrel I have no intention here to
                        inquire. It does not come within the purview of this volume of
                        reminiscences. <pb id="VAA2427-247" n="238"/> But in editing General
                        Beauregard's book I discovered an easy and certainly correct explanation of
                        the bitterest phase of itthat phase upon which General Beauregard laid
                        special stress.</p>
                    <p>Sometime after the battle of Shiloh, General Beauregard, whose health was
                        seriously impaired, decided to take a little furlough for purposes of
                        recuperation. There was neither prospect nor possibility of active military
                        operations in that quarter for a considerable time to come, so that he felt
                        himself free to go away for a few weeks in search of health, leaving General
                        Bragg in temporary command but himself keeping in touch with his army and in
                        readiness to return to it immediately in case of need.</p>
                    <p>He notified Mr. Davis of his intended course, by telegraph. Mr. Davis almost
                        immediately removed him from command and ordered General Bragg to assume
                        permanent control in that quarter. Mr. Davis's explanation, when his act was
                        challenged, was that General Beauregard had announced his purpose to be
                        absent himself "for four months," and that he, Mr. Davis, could not regard
                        that as anything else than an abandonment of his command. General Beauregard
                        insisted that he had made no such announcement and had cherished no such
                        purpose. The thing ultimately resolved itself into a question, of veracity
                        between the two, concerning which each had bitter things to say of the other
                        in public ways.</p>
                    <p>In editing General Beauregard's book, I discovered that there was really no
                        question of veracity involved, but merely an error of punctuation in a
                        telegraphic despatch, a thing very easy at all times and particularly easy
                        in days of military telegraphing when incompetent operators were the rule
                        rather than the exception.</p>
                    <p>The case was this: General Beauregard telegraphed:</p>
                    <p>"I am leaving for a while on surgeon's certificate. For <pb id="VAA2427-248"
                            n="239"/> four months I have delayed obeying their urgent
                        recommendations," etc.</p>
                    <p>As the despatch reached Mr. Davis it read:</p>
                    <p>"I am leaving for a while on surgeon's certificate for four months. I have
                        delayed," etc.</p>
                    <p>The misplacing of a punctuation mark gave the statement, as received by Mr.
                        Davis, a totally different meaning from that which General Beauregard had
                        intended. In explaining his action in removing Beauregard from command, Mr.
                        Davis stated that the General had announced his purpose to absent himself
                        for four months. General Beauregard denied that he had done anything of the
                        kind. Hence the issue of veracity, in which the text of the despatch as
                        sent, sustained General Beauregard's contention, while the same text as
                        received, with its error of punctuation, equally sustained the assertions of
                        Mr. Davis.</p>
                    <p>With the beatitude of the peacemakers in mind, I brought my discovery to the
                        attention of both parties to the controversy, in the hope at least of
                        convincing each that the other had not consciously lied. The attempt proved
                        futile. When I pointed out to General Beauregard the obvious origin of the
                        misapprehension, he flushed with suppressed anger and declared himself
                        unwilling to discuss a matter so exclusively personal. He did discuss it,
                        however, to the extent of pointing out that his use of the phrase "for a
                        while" should have enabled Mr. Davis to correct the telegraph operator's
                        error of punctuation, "if there really was any such error madewhich I am not
                        prepared to believe."</p>
                    <p>In answer to my letter to Mr. Davis, some one wrote for him that in his
                        advancing years he did not care to take up again any of the matters of
                        controversy that had perplexed his active life.</p>
                    <p>I have never since that time made the smallest attempt <pb id="VAA2427-249"
                            n="240"/> to reconcile the quarrels of men who have been engaged in the
                        making of history. I have learned better.</p>
                    <p>So far as Mr. Davis was concerned there was probably another reason for
                        unwillingness to consider any matter that I might lay before him. He and I
                        had had a little controversy of our own some years before.</p>
                    <p>In one of those chapters of "A Rebel's Recollections," which were first
                        published in the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly,</hi> I made certain
                        statements with regard to Mr. Davis's conduct at a critical moment. Mr.
                        Davis sent his secretary to meor at any rate some one calling himself his
                        secretary came to meto assure me that the statements I and others had made
                        concerning the matter were without foundation in fact, and to ask me not to
                        include them in the forthcoming book.</p>
                    <p>I replied that I had not made the statements thoughtlessly or without
                        satisfying myself of the correctness of my information; that I could not,
                        therefore, consent to omit them from the book; but that if Mr. Davis would
                        send me a categorical denial of them over his own signature, I would publish
                        it as a part of my text.</p>
                    <p>This proposal was rejected, and I let the matter stand as originally written.
                        I had in my possession at that time a letter from General Robert E. Lee to
                        John Esten Cooke. It was written in answer to a direct question of Mr.
                        Cooke's, and in it General Lee stated unequivocally that the facts were as
                        Mr. Cooke understood them and as I had reported them. But General Lee
                        forbade the publication of his letter unless Mr. Davis should at any time
                        publicly deny the reports made. In that case he authorized the publication
                        "in the interest of truthful history."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cooke had placed that letter in my hands, and had Mr. Davis furnished me
                        with the suggested denial, it was my purpose to print that and General Lee's
                        letter <pb id="VAA2427-250" n="241"/> in facsimile, leaving it for every
                        reader to choose between them. To my regret Mr. Davis declined to put his
                        denial into writing, so that General Lee's letter, which I returned to Mr.
                        Cooke, has never been published, and now never can be.</p>
                    <p>On another point I found General Beauregard more amenable to editorial
                        suggestion, though reluctantly so. In discussing his defense of Charleston
                        with utterly inadequate meansa defense everywhere recognized as the
                        sufficient foundation of a military famehis book included a chapter or so of
                        masterly military criticism, intended to show that if the commanders on the
                        other side at Charleston had been as alert and capable as they should have
                        been, there was no time when they could not have taken Charleston with ease
                        and certainty.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out to him that all this was a discrediting of himself; that it
                        attributed to the enemy's weakness a success which military criticism
                        attributed to his own military and engineering strength, thus stripping him
                        of credit at the very point at which his credit was least open to dispute or
                        question. I advised the elimination or material alteration of this part of
                        the book, and after due consideration he consented, though with sore
                        reluctance, for the reason that the modification made involved the sacrifice
                        of a very brilliant essay in military criticism, of which any writer might
                        well have been proud, and which I should have advised any other writer to
                        publish as a distinguished feature of his work.</p>
                    <p>To descend from large things to small ones, it was in seeing this work
                        through the press that I encountered the most extreme case I have ever known
                        of dangerous interference with copy on the part of the "Intelligent
                        compositor," passed by the "alert proofreader." The printing department of
                        the Harpers was as nearly perfect, in its organization and in the
                        supervision given to it by the <pb id="VAA2427-251" n="242"/> two
                        highly-skilled superintendents of its rival composing rooms, as any printing
                        department well can be. And yet it was there that the error occurred.</p>
                    <p>Of course I could not read the revised proofs of the book "by copy,"that is
                        to say with a helper to read the copy aloud while I followed him with the
                        revises. That would have required the employment of an additional helper and
                        a considerably increased payment to me. Moreover, all that was supposed to
                        be attended to in the composing rooms so that revised proofs should come to
                        me in exact conformity with the "copy" as I had handed it in. In reading
                        them I was not expected to look out for errors of the type, but solely for
                        errors in the text.</p>
                    <p>In reading a batch of proofs one nightfor the man of letters who would keep
                        his butcher and grocer on good terms with him must work by night as well as
                        by dayalthough I was in nowise on the alert to discover errors of type, my
                        eye fell upon an error which, if it had escaped me, would forever have
                        ruined my reputation as an editor. Certain of General Beauregard's official
                        despatches, quoted in the book, were dated "Fiddle Pond, near Barnwell C.
                        H., South Carolina," the letters "C. H." standing, of course, for "Court
                        House"the name given to rural county seats in the South. The intelligent
                        compositor, instead of "following copy," had undertaken to interpret and
                        translate the letters out of the depths of his own intuitions. Instead of
                        "Fiddle Pond, near Barnwell C. H.," he had set "Fiddle Pond, near Barnwell,
                        Charleston Harbor," thus playing havoc at once with geography and the
                        text.</p>
                    <p>The case was so extreme, and the liberty taken with the text without notice
                        of any kind, involved so much danger to the accuracy of the work that I had
                        no choice but to report the matter to the house with a notification <pb
                            id="VAA2427-252" n="243"/> that unless I could be assured that no
                        further liberties of any kind would be taken with the text, I must decline
                        to go further with the undertaking.</p>
                    <p>This cost a proofreader and a printer or two their employments, and I
                        regretted that, but they deserved their punishment, and the matter was one
                        that demanded drastic measures. Without such measures it would have been
                        dangerous to publish the book at all.</p>
                    <p>One other ex-Confederate general with whom this sort of editorial work
                        brought me into association was Loring Pachaotherwise General W. W. Loring,
                        a man of extraordinarily varied experiences in life, a man of the gentlest
                        temper and most genial impulses, who had been, nevertheless, a fighter all
                        his life, from boyhood up. His fighting, however, had all been done in the
                        field and professionally, and he carried none of its animosities into
                        private life. I remember his saying to me once:</p>
                    <p>"Of course the war ended as it ought to have done. It was best for everybody
                        concerned that the Union should be restored. The only thing is that I don't
                        like the other fellows to 'have the say' on us."</p>
                    <p>Loring became a private soldier in the United States Army while yet a boy. He
                        so far distinguished himself for gallantry in the Florida War that he was
                        offered a Presidential appointment to West Point, which he declined. He was
                        appointed to a lieutenancy in the regular army, where he won rapid promotion
                        and gained a deal of experience, chiefly in fighting Indians and leading
                        troops on difficult expeditions across the plains of the far West. In the
                        Mexican War he was several times promoted and brevetted for conspicuous
                        gallantry, and he lost an arm at one of the gates of the City of Mexico, as
                        he was leading his regiment as the head of the column into the town, seizing
                        an opportunity without orders. On that occasion General Scott visited him in
                        hospital and said to him:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-253" n="244"/>
                    <p>"Loring, I suppose I ought to court-martial you for rushing into that breach
                        without orders; but I think I'll recommend you for promotion instead."</p>
                    <p>In the Confederate Army Loring became a Major-General, and a few years after
                        the close of that struggle he was invited by the Khedive of Egypt to become
                        his chief of staff. After a military service there which extended over a
                        number of years, he returned to America and wrote a book founded upon his
                        experience there and the studies he had made in Egyptian manners, history,
                        archology, and the like. I was employed to edit that book, which was
                        published by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., I think, and in the course of my work
                        upon it Loring became not only a valued personal friend, but an easy-going
                        intimate in my household. At first he came to see me only for purposes of
                        consultation concerning the work. Later he used to come "just because he
                        wanted to," he said. His visits were made, in Southern fashion, at whatever
                        hour he chose, and he took with us whatever meals were served while he was
                        there.</p>
                    <p>In conversation one day I happened to ask Loring something about the strained
                        relations that frequently exist between commanding officers in the field and
                        the newspaper war correspondents sent out to report news of military
                        operations. I think my question was prompted by some reference to William
                        Swinton's criticisms of General Grant, and General Grant's peremptory
                        dealing with him.</p>
                    <p>"I don't know much about such things," Loring answered. "You see, at the time
                        of the Mexican War and of all my Indian campaigns, the newspapers hadn't yet
                        invented the war correspondent. Then in the Confederacy everybody was a
                        soldier, as you know, and the war correspondents carried muskets and
                        answered to roll calls. Their newspaper work was an avocation, not a
                        vocation. You see I am learning English under your tuition."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-254" n="245"/>
                    <p>This little jest referred to the fact that a few days before, in running
                        through the manuscript of a lecture he was preparing, I had changed the word
                        "avocation" to "vocation," explaining to him the difference in meaning.</p>
                    <p>"Then in Egypt we were not much troubled with war correspondentsperhaps they
                        had the bowstring and sack in mindbut I have an abiding grudge against
                        another type of correspondent whom I encountered there. I mean the tourist
                        who has made an arrangement with some newspaper to pay the expenses of his
                        trip or a part of them in return for letters to be sent from the places
                        visited. He is always an objectionable person, particularly when he happens
                        to be a parson out of a job, and I always fought shy of him so far as
                        possible, usually by turning him over to my dragoman, to be shown about and
                        'stuffed' as only a dragoman can 'stuff' anybody. You see the dragoman has
                        learned that every Western tourist in the East is hungry for information of
                        a startling sort, and the dragoman holds himself ready to furnish it without
                        the smallest regard for truth or any respect at all for facts. On one
                        occasion one of these scribbling tourists from England visited me. One of
                        the Khedive's unoccupied palaces had been assigned to me for my
                        headquarters, and I was exceedingly busy with preparations for a campaign
                        then in contemplation. Stone Pacha and I were both up to our eyes in work,
                        trying to mobilize an army that had no mobility in it. Accordingly I turned
                        the tourist over to my dragoman with orders to show him everything and give
                        him all the information he wanted.</p>
                    <p>"The palace was divided as usual. There was a public part and a part called
                        the haremwhich simply means the home or the family apartments. During my
                        occupancy of the place that part of it was empty and closed, as I am a
                        bachelor. But as the dragoman showed him <pb id="VAA2427-255" n="246"/>
                        about the tourist asked to see that part of the palace, whereupon the
                        dragoman replied:</p>
                    <p>"'That is the harem. You cannot gain entrance there.'</p>
                    <p>"'The harem? But I thought Loring was an American and a Christian,' was the
                        astonished reply.</p>
                    <p>"'He wasbut he is a pacha, now,' answered the dragoman with that air of
                        mysterious reserve which is a part of his stock in trade. Then the rascal
                        went on to tell the tourist that I now had forty wiveswhich would have been
                        a shot with the long bow even if I had been a born Mohammedan of the highest
                        rank and greatest wealth.</p>
                    <p>"When I heard of the affair I asked the dragoman why he had lied so
                        outrageously and he calmly replied:</p>
                    <p>"'Oh, I thought it polite to give the gentleman what he wanted.'</p>
                    <p>"I dismissed the matter and thought no more of it until a month or so later,
                        when somebody sent me marked copies of the <hi rend="i">Manchester
                            Guardian,</hi> or whatever the religious newspaper concerned was called.
                        The tourist had told the story of my 'downfall' with all the horrifying
                        particulars, setting forth in very complimentary phrases my simple,
                        exemplary life as an American soldier and lamenting the ease with which I
                        and other Western men, 'nurtured in the purity of Christian family life,'
                        had fallen victims to the lustful luxury of the East. I didn't give the
                        matter any attention. I was too busy to bothertoo busy with plans and
                        estimates and commissary problems, and the puzzles of transportation and all
                        the rest of the things that required attention in preparation for a campaign
                        in a difficult, inaccessible, and little known country. I wasn't thinking of
                        myself or of what wandering scribes might be writing about me in English
                        newspapers. But presently this thing assumed a new and very serious aspect.
                        Some obscure American religious newspaper, published <pb id="VAA2427-256"
                            n="247"/> down South somewhere, copied the thing, and my good sisters,
                        who live down that way, read it. It isn't much to say they were horrified;
                        they were well-nigh killed by the revelation of my infamy and they suffered
                        almost inconceivable tortures of the spirit on my account. For it never
                        entered their trustful minds to doubt anything printed in a great English
                        religious paper over the signature of a dissenting minister and copied into
                        the American religious journal which to them seemed an authoritative weekly
                        supplement to the holy scriptures.</p>
                    <p>"I managed to straighten the thing out in the minds of my good sisters, but I
                        have never ceased to regret that that correspondent never turned up at my
                        headquarters again. If he had I should have made him think he had fallen in
                        with a herd of the wild jackasses of Abyssinia."</p>

                    <p>M<hi rend="sc">ENTION</hi> of Loring's experience reminds me of an amusing
                        one of my own that occurred a little later. In the autumn of 1886 I made a
                        leisurely journey with my wife across the continent to California, Oregon,
                        Mexico, and all parts of the golden West. On an equally leisurely return
                        journey we took a train at Marshall, Texas, for New Orleans, over the ruins
                        of the Texas and Pacific Railroad, which Jay Gould had recently "looted to
                        the limit," as a banker described it. Besides myself, my wife, and our
                        child, the only passengers on the solitary buffet sleeping car were Mr.
                        Ziegenfust of the San Francisco <hi rend="i">Chronicle,</hi> and a young
                        lady who put herself under my wife's chaperonage. If Mr. Ziegenfust had not
                        been there to bear out my statements I should never have told the story of
                        what happened.</p>
                    <p>There was no conductor for the sleeping caronly a <pb id="VAA2427-257"
                            n="248"/> negro porter who acted as factotum. When I undertook to
                        arrange with him for my sleeping car accommodations, I offered him a gold
                        piece, for in drawing money from a San Francisco bank for use on the return
                        journey, I had received only gold.</p>
                    <p>The negro seemed started as I held out the coin.</p>
                    <p>"I can't take dat, boss," he said. "'Taint worf nuffin."</p>
                    <p>I made an effort to explain to him that American gold coin was not only the
                        supreme standard by which all values were measured in this country, but that
                        as mere metal it was worth the sum stamped upon it in any part of the earth.
                        Mr. Ziegenfust supported me in these statements, but our combined assurances
                        made no impression upon the porter's mind. He perfectly knew that gold coin
                        was as worthless as dead forest leaves, and he simply would not take the
                        twenty-dollar piece offered him.</p>
                    <p>We decided that the poor fellow was a fool, and after a search through all
                        the pockets on the car we managed to get together the necessary number of
                        dollars in greenbacks with which to pay for my accommodations. As for what
                        we might want to eat from the buffetfor there were no dining cars in those
                        daysthe porter assured me he would "trust me" till we should get to New
                        Orleans, and call upon me at my hotel to receive his pay.</p>
                    <p>Next morning we found ourselves stranded at Plaque-mine, by reason of a train
                        wreck a few miles ahead. Plaquemine is the center of the district to which
                        the banished Acadians of Longfellow's story fled for refuge, and most of the
                        people there claim descent from Evangeline, in jaunty disregard of the fact
                        that that young lady of the long ago was never married. But Plaquemine is a
                        thriving provincial town, and when I learned that we must lie there,
                        wreck-bound, for at least six hours, I thought I saw my opportunity. I went
                        out into the town <pb id="VAA2427-258" n="249"/> to get some of my gold
                        pieces converted into greenbacks.</p>
                    <p>To my astonishment I found everybody there like-minded with the negro porter
                        of my sleeping car. They were all convinced that American gold coin was a
                        thing of no value, and for reason they told me that "the government has went
                        back on it." It was in vain for me to protest that the government had
                        nothing to do with determining the value of a gold piece except to certify
                        its weight and fineness; that the piece of gold was intrinsically worth its
                        face as mere metal, and all the rest of the obvious facts of the case. These
                        people knew that "the government has went back on gold"that was the phrase
                        all of them usedand they would have none of it.</p>
                    <p>In recognition of the superior liberality of mind concerning financial
                        matters that distinguishes the barkeeper from all other small tradesmen, I
                        went into the saloon of the principal hotel of the town, and said to the man
                        of multitudinous bottles:</p>
                    <p>"It's rather early in the morning, but some of these gentlemen," waving my
                        hand toward the loafers on the benches, "may be thirsty. I'll be glad to
                        'set 'em up' for the company if you'll take your pay out of a twenty-dollar
                        gold piece and give me change for it."</p>
                    <p>There was an alert and instant response from the "gentlemen" of the benches,
                        who promptly aligned themselves before the bar and stood ready to "name
                        their drinks," but the barkeeper shook his head.</p>
                    <p>"Stranger," he said, "if you must have a drink you can have it and welcome.
                        But I can't take gold money. 'Taint worth nothin'. You see the government
                        has went back on it."</p>
                    <p>I declined the gratuitous drink he so generously offered, and took my
                        departure, leaving the "gentlemen" of the benches thirsty.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-259" n="250"/>
                    <p>Finally, I went to the principal merchant of the place, feeling certain that
                        he at least knew the fundamental facts of money values. I explained my
                        embarrassment and asked him to give me greenbacks for one or more of my gold
                        pieces.</p>
                    <p>He was an exceedingly courteous and kindly person. He said to me in better
                        English than I had heard that morning.</p>
                    <p>"Well, you may not know it, but the government has gone back on gold, so that
                        we don't know what value it may have. But I can't let a stranger leave our
                        town under such embarrassment as yours seems to be, particularly as you have
                        your wife and child with you. I'll give you currency for one of your gold
                        pieces, and <hi rend="i">take my chances of getting something for the
                            coin.</hi>"</p>
                    <p>I tried to explain finance to him, and particularly the insignificance of the
                        government's relation to the intrinsic value of gold coin, but my words made
                        no impression upon his mind. I could only say, therefore, that I would
                        accept his hospitable offer to convert one of my coins into greenbacks, with
                        the assurance that I should not think of doing so if I did not perfectly
                        know that he took no risk whatever in making the exchange.</p>
                    <p>In New Orleans I got an explanation of this curious scare. When the Civil War
                        broke out there was a good deal of gold coin in circulation in the
                        Plaquemine region. During and after the war the coins passed freely and
                        frequently from hand to hand, particularly in cotton buying transactions.
                        Not long before the time of my visit, some merchants in Plaquemine had sent
                        a lot of this badly worn gold to New Orleans in payment of duties on
                        imported goodsa species of payment which was then, foolishly, required to be
                        made in gold alone. The customs officers had rejected this Plaquemine gold,
                        because it was worn to light weight. Hence the conviction in <pb
                            id="VAA2427-260" n="251"/> Plaquemine that the government had "went
                        back" on gold.</p>
                    <p>At that time the principal subject of discussion in Congress and the
                        newspapers was the question of free silver coinage, the exclusive gold
                        standard of values, or a double standard, and all the rest of it, and those
                        who contended for an exclusive gold standard were stigmatized as "gold
                        bugs."</p>
                    <p>I was then editor-in-chief of the <hi rend="i">New York Commercial
                            Advertiser,</hi> and in my absence my brilliant young friend, Henry
                        Marquand, was in charge of the paper. Thinking to amuse our readers I sent
                        him a playful letter recounting these Plaquemine experiences, and he
                        published it under the title of "A Stranded Goldbug."</p>
                    <p>The humor of the situation described was so obvious and so timely that my
                        letter was widely copied throughout the country, and a copy of it fell into
                        the hands of a good but too serious-minded kinswoman of mine, an active
                        worker in the W. C. T. U. She was not interested in the humor of my
                        embarrassment, but she wrote me a grieved and distressed letter, asking how
                        I could ever have gone into the saloon of that Plaquemine hotel, or any
                        other place where alcoholic beverages were sold, and much else to the like
                        effect. I was reminded of Loring's experience, and was left to wonder how
                        large a proportion of those who had read my letter had missed the humor of
                        the matter in their shocked distress over the fact that by entering a hotel
                        caf I had lent my countenance to the sale of beer and the like.</p>
                    <p>I had not then learned, as I have since done, how exceedingly and even
                        exigently sensitive consciences of a certain class are as to such matters.
                        Not many years ago I published a boys' book about a flat-boat voyage down
                        the Mississippi. At New Orleans a commission merchant, anxious to give the
                        country boys as much as he could of <pb id="VAA2427-261" n="252"/> enjoyment
                        in the city, furnished tickets and bade them "go to the opera to-night and
                        hear some good music." Soon after the book came out my publishers wrote me
                        that they had a Sunday School Association's order for a thousand copies of
                        the book, but that it was conditioned upon our willingness to change the
                        word "opera" to "concert" in the sentence quoted.</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>LVIII</head>
                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">S</hi> a literary adviser of the Harpers, I very earnestly
                        urged them to publish Mrs. Custer's "Boots and Saddles." In my "opinion"
                        recommending its acceptance, I said that their other readers would probably
                        be unanimous in advising its rejection, and would offer excellent reasons in
                        support of that advice. I added that those very reasons were the promptings
                        of my advice to the contrary.</p>
                    <p>When all the opinions were inall but mine being adverseMr. Joe Harper sent
                        copies of them to me, asking me to read them carefully and, after
                        consideration, to report whether or not I still adhered to my opinion in
                        favor of the book. I promptly replied that I did, giving my reasons, which
                        were based mainly on the very considerations urged by the other readers in
                        behalf of rejection. In my earnestness I ventured, as I had never done
                        before, upon a prediction. I said that in my opinion the book would reach a
                        sale of twenty thousand copiesa figure then considered very great for the
                        sale of any current book.</p>
                    <p>A month after "Boots and Saddles" was published, I happened to be in the
                        Harper offices, and Mr. Joe Harper beckoned me to him. With a very solemn
                        countenance, which did not hide the twinkle in his eye, he said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-262" n="253"/>
                    <p>"Of course, when you make a cock-sure prediction as to the sale of a book,
                        and we accept it on the strength of your enthusiastic advice, we expect you
                        to make the failure good."</p>
                    <p>"To what book do you refer?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"Mrs. Custer's. You predicted a sale of twenty thousand for it, and it has
                        now been out a full month and"</p>
                    <p>"What are the figures for the first month, Mr. Harper?" I interrupted.</p>
                    <p>"Well, what do you think? It is the first month that sets the pace, you know.
                        What's your guess?"</p>
                    <p>"Ten thousand," I ventured.</p>
                    <p>"What? Of that book? In its first month? Are you a rainbow chaser?"</p>
                    <p>I had caught the glint in his eye, and so I responded:</p>
                    <p>"Oh, well, if that guess is so badly out I'll double it, and say twenty
                        thousand."</p>
                    <p>"Do you mean thatseriously?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, quite seriously. So seriously that I'll agree to pay the royalties on
                        all copies short of twenty thousand, if you'll agree to give me a sum equal
                        to the royalties on all copies sold in excess of that number."</p>
                    <p>He chuckled inwardly but audibly. Then, picking up a paper from his desk, he
                        passed it to me, saying:</p>
                    <p>"Look. There are the figures."</p>
                    <p>The sales had amounted to some hundred more than the twenty thousand I had
                        guessed, and there were no indications of any early falling off of the
                        orders that were daily and hourly coming in.</p>
                    <p>I mention this case of successful prediction because it gives me a text for
                        saying that ordinarily there is nothing so utterly impossible as foresight,
                        of any trustworthy sort, concerning the sale of a book. In this case the
                        fact that "Boots and Saddles" was the very unliterary, and altogether
                        winning tribute of a loving wife to her dead hero <pb id="VAA2427-263"
                            n="254"/> husband, afforded a secure ground of prediction. The book
                        appealed to sentiments with which every human heartcoarse or refined, high,
                        low, or middle classis in eternal sympathy. Ordinarily there is no such
                        secure ground upon which to base a prediction of success for any book. The
                        plate-room of every publisher is the graveyard of a multitude of books that
                        promised well but died young, and the plates are their headstones. Every
                        publisher has had experiences that convince him of the impossibility of
                        discovering beforehand what books will sell well and what will "die
                        a-borning." Every publisher has had books of his publishing succeed far
                        beyond his expectations, and other books fail, on the success of which he
                        had confidently reckoned. And the worst of it is that the quality of a book
                        seems to have little or nothing to do with the matter, one way or the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>One night at the Authors Club, I sat with a group of prolific and successful
                        authors, and as a matter of curious interest I asked each of them to say how
                        far their own and their publishers' anticipations with respect to the
                        comparative success of their several books had been borne out by the actual
                        sales. Almost every one of them had a story to tell of disappointment with
                        the books that were most confidently expected to succeed, and of the success
                        of other books that had been regarded as least promising.</p>
                    <p>The experience is as old as literature itself, doubtless. Thomas Campbell
                        came even to hate his "Pleasures of Hope," because its fame completely
                        overshadowed that of "Gertrude of Wyoming" and some other poems of his which
                        he regarded as immeasurably superior to that work. He resented the fact that
                        in introducing him or otherwise mentioning him everybody added to his name
                        the phrase "Author of the 'Pleasures of Hope,'" and he bitterly predicted
                        that when he died somebody would carve that <pb id="VAA2427-264" n="255"/>
                        detested legend upon his tombstone. In the event, somebody did.</p>
                    <p>A lifelong intimate of George Eliot once told me that bitterness was mingled
                        with the wine of applause in her cup, because, as she said: "A stupid public
                        persists in neglecting my poems, which are far superior to anything I ever
                        wrote in prose."</p>
                    <p>In the same way such fame as Thomas Dunn English won, rested mainly upon the
                        song of "Ben Bolt." Yet one day during his later years I heard him angrily
                        say in response to some mention of that song: "Oh, damn 'Ben Bolt.' It rides
                        me like an incubus."</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>LIX</head>
                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HILE</hi> I was conducting my literary shop at home, there
                        came to me many persons bearing letters of introduction which I was in
                        courtesy bound to honor. Some of these brought literary work of an
                        acceptable sort for me to do. Through them a numberperhaps a dozen or soof
                        books were brought to me to edit, and in the course of the work upon such
                        books I made a few familiar friends, whose intimacy in my household was a
                        pleasure to me and my family while the friends in question lived. They are
                        all dead nowor nearly all.</p>
                    <p>But mainly the bearers of letters of introduction who came to me at that time
                        were very worthy persons who wanted to do literary work, but had not the
                        smallest qualification for it. Some of them had rejected manuscripts which
                        they were sure that I, "with my influence," could easily market to the
                        replenishment of their emaciated purses. For the conviction that the
                        acceptance of manuscripts goes chiefly by favor is ineradicable from the
                        amateur literary <pb id="VAA2427-265" n="256"/> mind. I have found it quite
                        useless to explain to such persons that favor has nothing to do with the
                        matter, that every editor and every publisher is always and eagerly alert to
                        discern new writers of promise and to exploit them. The persons to whom
                        these truths are told, simply do not believe them. They <hi rend="i"
                            >know</hi> that their own stories or essays or what not, are far
                        superior to those accepted and published. Every one of their friends has
                        assured them of that, and their own consciousness confirms the judgment.
                        Scores of them have left my library in full assurance that I was a member of
                        some "literary ring," that was organized to exclude from publication the
                        writings of all but the members of the ring. It was idle to point out to
                        them the introduction of Saxe Holm, of Constance Fenimore Woolson, of Mrs.
                        Custer, of Charles Egbert Craddock, or of any other of a dozen or more new
                        writers who had recently come to the front. They were assured that each of
                        these had enjoyed the benefits of "pull" of some sort.</p>
                    <p>One charming young lady of the "Society" sort brought me half a dozen letters
                        of introduction from persons of social prominence, urging her upon my
                        attention. She had written a "Society novel," she told me, and she wanted to
                        get it published. She was altogether too well informed as to publishing
                        conditions, to send her manuscript to any publisher without first securing
                        "influence" in its behalf. She was perfectly well aware that I was a person
                        possessed of influence, and so she had come to me. Wouldn't I, for a
                        consideration, secure the acceptance of her novel by some reputable
                        house?</p>
                    <p>I told her that "for a consideration"namely, fifty dollarsI would read her
                        manuscript and give her a judgment upon its merits, after which she might
                        offer it to any publisher she saw fit, and that that was all I could do for
                        her.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-266" n="257"/>
                    <p>"But you are 'on the inside' at Harpers'," she replied, "and of course your
                        verdict is conclusive with them."</p>
                    <p>"In some cases it is," I answered. "It has proved to be so in one peculiar
                        case. I recently sold the Harpers a serial story of my own for their <hi
                            rend="i">Young People.</hi> Afterwards a story of Captain Kirk Munroe's
                        came to me for judgment. It covered so nearly the same ground that mine did,
                        that both could not be used. But his story seemed to me so much better than
                        my own, for the use proposed, that I advised the Harpers to accept it and
                        return to me my own already accepted manuscript. They have acted upon my
                        advice and I am a good many hundreds of dollars out of pocket in
                        consequence. Now, my dear Miss Browneyes," I added, "you see upon what my
                        influence with the Harpers rests. In so far as they accept literary
                        productions upon my advice, they do so simply because they know that my
                        advice is honest and represents my real judgment of the merits of things
                        offered for publication. If I should base my recommendations upon any other
                        foundation than that of integrity and an absolutely sincere critical
                        judgment, I should soon have no more influence with the Harpers than any
                        truckman in the streets can command. I will read your manuscript and give
                        you my honest opinion of it, for fifty dollars, if you wish me to do so. But
                        I do not advise you to do that. Judging of it in advance, from what I have
                        seen of you, and from what I know of the limitations of the Society life you
                        have led, I strongly advise you not to waste fifty dollars of your father's
                        money in that way. It is scarcely conceivable that with your very limited
                        knowledge of life, and your carefully restricted outlook, you can have
                        written a novel of any value whatever. You had better save your fifty
                        dollars to help pay for your next love of a bonnet."</p>
                    <p>"I'm awfully disappointed," she said. "You see it <pb id="VAA2427-267"
                            n="258"/> would be so nice to have all my Society friends talking about
                        'Lily Browneyes's book,' and perhaps that ought to be considered. You see
                        almost every one of my Society friends would buy the book 'just to see what
                        that little chatterbox, Lily Browneyes, has found to write about.' I should
                        think that would make the fortune of the book."</p>
                    <p>"How many Society friends have you, Miss Brown-eyes?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, heaps of themscoresdead oodles and scads of 'em, as we girls say."</p>
                    <p>"But really, how many?" I persisted. "Suppose your book were published, how
                        many of your Society friends could you confidently reckon upon as probable
                        purchasers? Here's paper and a pencil. Suppose you set down their names and
                        tot them up."</p>
                    <p>She eagerly undertook the task, and after half an hour she had a list of
                        forty-odd persons who would pretty surely buy the book" if they couldn't
                        borrow it," she added.</p>
                    <p>I explained the matter to her somewhatdwelling upon the fact that a sale of
                        two thousand copies would barely reimburse the publisher's outlay.</p>
                    <p>She said I had been "very nice" to her, but on the whole she decided to
                        accept my advice and not pay me fifty dollars for a futile reading of the
                        manuscript. I was glad of that. For it seemed like breaking a butterfly to
                        disappoint so charming a young girl.</p>
                    <p>The letters Lily Browneyes brought me had at least the merit of sincerity.
                        They were meant to help her accomplish her purpose, and not as so many
                        letters of the kind are, to get rid of importunity by shifting it to the
                        shoulders of some one else. I remember something that illustrates my
                        meaning.</p>
                    <p>I presided, many years ago, at a banquet given by the Authors Club to Mr.
                        William Dean Howells. Nothing <pb id="VAA2427-268" n="259"/> was
                        prearranged. There was no schedule of toasts in my hand, no list of speakers
                        primed to respond to them. With so brilliant a company to draw upon I had no
                        fear as to the results of calling up the man I wanted, without warning.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the haphazard performance, it occurred to me that we ought
                        to have a speech from some publisher, and accordingly I called upon Mr. J.
                        Henry Harper"Harry Harper," we who knew and loved him called him.</p>
                    <p>His embarrassment was positively painful to behold. He made no attempt
                        whatever to respond but appealed to me to excuse him.</p>
                    <p>At that point Mark Twain came to the rescue by offering to make Mr. Harper's
                        speech for him. "I'm a publisher myself," he explained, "and I'll speak for
                        the publishers."</p>
                    <p>A roar of applause welcomed the suggestion, and Mr. Clemens proceeded to make
                        the speech. In the course of it he spoke of the multitude of young authors
                        who beset every publisher and beseech him for advice after he has explained
                        that their manuscripts are "not available" for publication by his own firm,
                        with its peculiar limitations. Most publishers cruelly refuse, he said, to
                        do anything for these innocents. "I never do that," he added. "I always give
                        them good advice, and more than that, I always do something for them<hi
                            rend="i">I give them notes of introduction to Gilder."</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I am persuaded that many scores of the notes of introduction brought to me
                        have been written in precisely that spirit of helpless helpfulness.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, however, letters of introduction, given thoughtlessly, are
                        productive of trouble far more serious than the mere waste of a busy man's
                        time. It is a curious fact that most persons stand ready to give letters of
                        introduction <pb id="VAA2427-269" n="260"/> upon acquaintance so slender
                        that they would never think of personally introducing the two concerned, or
                        personally vouching for the one to whom the letter is given.</p>
                    <p>When I was editing <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> Theodore Tilton gave a
                        young Indiana woman a letter of introduction to me. He afterwards admitted
                        to me that he knew nothing whatever about the young woman.</p>
                    <p>"But what can one do in such a case?" he asked. "She was charming and she
                        wanted to know you; she was interested in you as a Hoosier writer"the
                        Indiana school of literature had not established itself at that early
                        day"and when she learned that I knew you well she asked for a letter of
                        introduction. What could I do? Could I say to her, 'My dear young lady, I
                        know very little about you, and my friend, George Cary Eggleston, is so
                        innocent and unsophisticated a person that I dare not introduce you to him
                        without some certificate of character?' No. I could only give her the letter
                        she wanted, trusting you to discount any commendatory phrases it might
                        contain, in the light of your acquaintance with the ways of a world in which
                        letters of introduction are taken with grains of salt. Really, if I mean to
                        commend one person to another, I always send a private letter to indorse my
                        formal letter of introduction, and to assure my friend that there are no
                        polite lies in it."</p>
                    <p>In this case the young woman did nothing very dreadful. Her character was
                        doubtless above reproach and her reformatory impulses were no more offensive
                        than reformatory impulses that concern others usually are. My only complaint
                        of her was that she condemned me without a hearing, giving me no opportunity
                        to say why sentence should not be pronounced upon me.</p>
                    <p>In her interview, she was altogether charming. She was fairly well acquainted
                        with literature, and was keenly appreciative <pb id="VAA2427-270" n="261"/>
                        of it. We talked for an hour on such subjects, and then she went away. A
                        week or so later she sent me a copy of the Indiana newspaper for which she
                        was a correspondent. In it was a page interview with me in which all that I
                        had said and a great deal that I had not said was set forth in detail. There
                        was also a graphic description of my office surroundings. Among these
                        surroundings was my pipe, which lay "naked and not ashamed" on my desk.
                        Referring to it, the young woman wrote that one saddening thing in her visit
                        to me was the discovery that "this gifted young man is a victim of the
                        tobacco habit."</p>
                    <p>Worse still, she emphasized that lamentable discovery in her headlines, and
                        made so much of her compassionate regret that if I had been an inmate of a
                        lunatic asylum, demented by the use of absinthe or morphine, her pity could
                        hardly have been more active.</p>
                    <p>I do not know that this exhibition of reformatory ill manners did me any
                        serious harm, but it annoyed me somewhat.</p>
                    <p>When I was serving as literary editor of the <hi rend="i">Evening Post,</hi>
                        a very presentable person came to me bearing a note of introduction from
                        Richard Henry Stoddard. Mr. Stoddard introduced the gentleman as James R.
                        Randall, author of "My Maryland" and at that time editor of a newspaper in
                        Augusta, Georgia. Mr. Randall was a person whom I very greatly wanted to
                        know, but it was late on a Saturday afternoon, and I had an absolutely
                        peremptory engagement that compelled me to quit the office immediately.
                        Accordingly, I invited the visitor to dine with me at my house the next day,
                        Sunday, and he accepted.</p>
                    <p>Sunday came and the dinner was served, but Mr. Randall was not there. Next
                        morning I learned that on the plea of Saturday afternoon and closed banks he
                        had borrowed <pb id="VAA2427-271" n="262"/> thirty-five dollars from one of
                        my fellow-editors before leaving. This, taken in connection with his failure
                        to keep his dinner engagement with me, aroused suspicion. I telegraphed to
                        Augusta, asking the newspaper with which Mr. Randall was editorially
                        connected whether or not Mr. Randall was in New York. Mr. Randall himself
                        replied saying that he was not in New York and requesting me to secure the
                        arrest of any person trying to borrow money or get checks cashed in his
                        name. He added: "When I travel I make my financial arrangements in advance
                        and don't borrow money of friends or strangers."</p>
                    <p>When I notified Stodclard of the situation, so that he might not commend his
                        friend, "Mr. Randall," to others, 1 expressed the hope that he had not
                        himself lent the man any money. In reply he said:</p>
                    <p>"Lent him money? Why, my dear George Cary Eggleston, what a creative
                        imagination you must have! 'You'd orter 'a' been a poet.' Still, if I had
                        had any money, as of course I hadn't, I should have lent it to him freely.
                        As he didn't ask for itprobably he knew my chronic impecuniosity too well to
                        do thatI didn't know he was 'on the borrow.' Anyhow, I'm going to run him to
                        earth."</p>
                    <p>And he did. It appeared in the outcome that the man had called upon Edmund
                        Clarence Stedman, bearing a letter from Sidney Lanierforged, of course.
                        Stedman had taken him out to lunch and then, as he expressed a wish to meet
                        the literary men of the town, had given him a note of introduction to
                        Stoddard together with several other such notes to men of letters, which
                        were never delivered. The man proved to be the "carpetbag" ex-Governor
                        Moses, who had looted the state of South Carolina, to an extent that
                        threatened the bankruptcy of that commonwealth. He had saved little if
                        anything out of <pb id="VAA2427-272" n="263"/> his plunderings, and,
                        returning to the North, had entered upon a successful career as a
                        "confidence man." He was peculiarly well-equipped for the part. Sagacious,
                        well-informed, educated, and possessed of altogether pleasing manners, he
                        succeeded in imposing himself upon the unsuspecting for many years. At last,
                        some years after my first encounter with him, he was "caught in the act" of
                        swindling, and sent for a term to the Massachusetts state prison.</p>
                    <p>On his release, at the end of his sentence, he resumed his old business of
                        victimizing the unsuspiciousamong whom I was one. It was only a few years
                        ago when he rang my door bell and introduced himself as a confidential
                        employee of the Lothrop Publishing Company of Boston, who were my
                        publishers. He had seen me, he said, during the only visit I had ever made
                        to the offices of the company, but had not had the pleasure of an
                        introduction. Being in New York he had given himself the pleasure of
                        calling, the more because he wished to consult me concerning the artistic
                        make-up of a book I then had in preparation at the Lothrops'.</p>
                    <p>His face seemed familiar to me, a fact which I easily accounted for on the
                        theory that I must have seen him during my visit to the publishing house.
                        For the rest he was a peculiarly agreeable person, educated, refined, and
                        possessed of definite ideas. We smoked together, and as an outcome of the
                        talk about cigars, I gave him something unusual. An indiscreetly lavish
                        friend of mine had given me a box of gigantic cigars, each of which was
                        encased in a glass tube, and each of which had cost a dollar. I was so
                        pleased with my visitor that I gave him one of these, saying that it didn't
                        often happen to a man who had anything to do with literature to smoke a
                        dollar cigar.</p>
                    <p>At the end of his visit he somewhat casually mentioned <pb id="VAA2427-273"
                            n="264"/> the fact that he and his wife were staying at the Astor House,
                        adding:</p>
                    <p>"We were anxious to leave for Boston by a late train to-night but I find it
                        impracticable to do so. I've suffered myself to run short of money and my
                        wife has made the matter worse by indulging in an indiscreet shopping tour
                        to-day. I have telegraphed to Boston for a remittance and must wait over
                        till it comes to-morrow. It is a very great annoyance, as I am needed in
                        Boston to-morrow, but there is no help for it."</p>
                    <p>I asked him how much money was absolutely necessary to enable him to leave by
                        the late train, which there was still time to catch, and after a moment of
                        mental figuring, he fixed upon the sum of sixteen dollars and fifty cents as
                        sufficient.</p>
                    <p>It was Sunday night and I had only a dollar or so in my pocket, but with a
                        keenly realizing sense of his embarrassment, I drew upon my wife's little
                        store of household change, and made up the sum required. He seemed very
                        grateful for the accommodation, but before leaving he asked me to let him
                        take one of those dollar cigars, to show to a friend in Boston.</p>
                    <p>About half an hour after he had left, I suddenly remembered him and
                        identified him as Mosesex-carpetbag governor of South Carolina, ex-convict,
                        and <hi rend="i">never ex</hi>-swindler. A few calls over the telephone
                        confirmed my conviction and my memory fully sustained my recollection of the
                        man. A day or two later he was arrested in connection with an attempted
                        swindle, but I did not bother to follow him up. I acted upon the dictum of
                        one of the most successful men I ever knew, that "it's tomfoolery to send
                        good money after bad."</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was during the period of my withdrawal from newspaper
                        work that Mr. Edmund Gosse made his first visit to this country. At that
                        time he had not yet made the reputation he has since achieved for
                        scholarship and literary accomplishment. As a scholar he was young and
                        promising rather than a man of established reputation. As a writer he was
                        only beginning to be known. But he was an Englishman of letters and an
                        agreeable gentleman, wherefore we proceeded to dine him and wine him and
                        make much of himall of which helped the success of his lecture course.</p>
                    <p>I interrupt myself at this point to say that we do these things more
                        generously and more lavishly than our kin beyond sea ever think of doing
                        them. With the exception of Mark Twain, no living American author visiting
                        England is ever received with one-half, or one-quarter, or one-tenth the
                        attention that Americans have lavished upon British writers of no greater
                        consequence than our own. If Irving Bacheller, or Charles Egbert Craddock,
                        or Post Wheeler, or R. W. Chambers, or Miss Johnston, or Will Harben, or
                        Thomas Nelson Page, or James Whitcomb Riley, or any other of a score that
                        might be easily named should visit London, does anybody imagine that he or
                        she would receive even a small fraction of the attention we have given to
                        Sarah Grand, Mr. Yeats, Max O'Rell, B. L. Farjeon, Mrs. Humphry Ward, Mr.
                        Locke, and others? Would even Mr. Howells be made to feel that he was
                        appreciated there as much as many far inferior English writers have been in
                        New York? Are we helplessly provincial or hopelessly snobbish? Or is it that
                        our English literary visitors make more skilful use of the press agent's
                        peculiar gifts? Or is it, perhaps, <pb id="VAA2427-275" n="266"/> that we
                        are more generous and hospitable than the English?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gosse, at any rate, was worthy of all the attention he received, and his
                        later work has fully justified it, so that nothing in the vagrant paragraph
                        above is in any way applicable to him.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gosse had himself carefully "coached" before he visited America. When he
                        came to us he knew what every man of us had done in literature, art,
                        science, or what not, and so far he made no mistakes either of ignorance or
                        of misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>"Bless my soul!" said James R. Osgood to me at one of the breakfasts,
                        luncheons or banquets given to the visitor, "he has committed every American
                        publishers' catalogue to memory, and knows precisely where each of you
                        fellows stands."</p>
                    <p>Upon one point, however, Mr. Gosse's conceptions were badly awry. He bore the
                        Civil War in mind, and was convinced that its bitternesses were still an
                        active force in our social life. One night at the Authors Club I was talking
                        with him when my brother Edward came up to us and joined in the
                        conversation. Mr. Gosse seemed surprised and even embarrassed. Presently he
                        said:</p>
                    <p>"It's extremely gratifying, you know, but this is a surprise to me. I
                        understand that you two gentlemen held opposite views during the war, and
                        one of the things my mentors in England most strongly insisted upon was that
                        I should never mention either of you in talking with the other. It is very
                        gratifying to find that you are on terms with each other."</p>
                    <p>"On terms?" said Edward. "Why, Geordie and I have always been twins. I was
                        born two years earlier than he wras, but we've been twin brothers
                        nevertheless, all our lives. You see, we were born almost exactly on <pb
                            id="VAA2427-276" n="267"/> the line between the North and the South, and
                        one fell over to one side and the other to the other. But there was never
                        anything but affection between us."</p>
                    <p>On another occasion Mr. Joe Harper gave a breakfast to Mr. Gosse at the
                        University Club. There were seventy or eighty gueststoo many for anything
                        like intimate converse. To remedy this Mr. Harper asked about a dozen of us
                        to remain after the function was over, gather around him at the head of the
                        tabletell all the stories we could remember, and "give Mr. Gosse a real
                        insight into our ways of thinking," he said.</p>
                    <p>Gordon McCabe and I were in the group, and Mr. Gosse, knowing perfectly what
                        each of us had written, knew, of course, that McCabe and I had fought on the
                        Southern side during the Civil War. If he had not known the fact in that way
                        he must have discovered it from the stories we told of humorous happenings
                        in the Confederate service. Yet here we were, on the most cordial terms with
                        men who had been on the other side. It was all a bewildering mystery to Mr.
                        Gosse, and presently he ventured to ask about it.</p>
                    <p>"Pardon me," he said to Mr. Harper, "it is all very gratifying, I'm sure, but
                        I don't quite understand. I think Mr. Eggleston and Mr. McCabe were in
                        active service on the Southern side during the war?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes," answered Mr. Harper, "and they have told us all about it in their
                        books."</p>
                    <p>"And the rest of you gentlemen sided with the North?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Well, it's very gratifying, of course, but it is astonishing to a stranger
                        to find you all on such terms of friendship again."</p>
                    <p>"Isn't it?" broke in Mr. Harper. "Here we are, having champagne together
                        quite like old friends, while we all know that only a dozen years or so ago,
                        McCabe <pb id="VAA2427-277" n="268"/> and Eggleston were down there at
                        Petersburg trying with all their might to <hi rend="i">Kill our
                            substitutes."</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The company laughed heartily at the witticism. Mr. Gosse smiled and a little
                        later, in an aside, he asked me to explain just what Mr. Harper had meant by
                        "substitutes."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gosse left a sweet taste in our mouths when he sailed for home. The
                        attentions he had received here had in no way spoiled him. From beginning to
                        end of his stay he never once manifested the least feeling of superiority,
                        and never once did his manner suggest that British condescension, which is
                        at once so amusing and so insulting to Americans. The same thing was true of
                        Matthew Arnold, who, I remember, made himself a most agreeable guest at a
                        reception the Authors Club gave him in the days of its extreme poverty. But
                        not all English men of letters whom I have met have been like-minded with
                        these. A certain fourth- or fifth-rate English novelist, who was made the
                        guest of honor at a dinner at the Lotus Club, said to me, as I very well
                        remember: "Of course you have no literature of your own and you must depend
                        for your reading matter upon us at home." The use of "at home" meaning "in
                        England," was always peculiarly offensive in my ears, but my interlocutor
                        did not recognize its offensiveness. "But really, you know, your people
                        ought to pay for it."</p>
                    <p>He was offering this argument to me in behalf of international copyright, my
                        interest in which was far greater than his own. For because of the
                        competition of ten-cent reprints of English books, I was forbidden to make a
                        living by literature and compelled to serve as a hired man on a newspaper
                        instead.</p>
                    <p>A few of our English literary visitors have come to us with the modest
                        purposes of the tourist, interested in what our country is and means. The
                        greater number have <pb id="VAA2427-278" n="269"/> come to exploit the
                        country "for what there is in it," by lecturing. Their lecture managers have
                        been alert and exceedingly successful in making advertising agencies of our
                        clubs, our social organizations, and even our private parlors, by way of
                        drawing money into the purses of their clients.</p>
                    <p>Did anybody ever hear of an American author of equal rank with these going to
                        England on a lecture or reading tour, and getting himself advertised by
                        London clubs and in London drawing-rooms in the like fashion? And if any
                        American authoreven one of the highest rankshould try to do anything of the
                        sort, would his bank account swell in consequence as those of our British
                        literary visitors do? Are we, after all, provincial? Have we not yet
                        achieved our intellectual and social independence?</p>
                    <p>I am persuaded that some of us have, though not many. One night at a club I
                        asked Brander Matthews if I should introduce him to a second-rate English
                        man of letters who had been made a guest of the evening. He answered:</p>
                    <p>"Nounless you particularly wish it. I'd rather talk to you and the other good
                        fellows here. He hasn't anything to say that would interest me, unless it is
                        something he has put into the lectures he's going to deliver, and he can't
                        afford to waste on us any of that small stock of interesting things."</p>
                    <p>But as a people, have we outgrown our provincialism? Have we achieved our
                        intellectual independence? Have we learned to value our own judgments, our
                        own thinking, our own convictions independently of English approval or
                        disapproval? I fear we have not, even in criticism. When the novel
                        "Democracy" appeared I wrote a column or two about it in the Evening Post,
                        treating it as a noteworthy reflection of our own life, political and
                        socialnot very great but worthy of attention. The impulse of my article was
                        that the literature of a country should <pb id="VAA2427-279" n="270"/> be a
                        showing forth of its life, its thought, its inspirations, its aspirations,
                        its character, its strength, and its weaknesses. That anonymous novel seemed
                        to me to be a reflection of all these things in some degree and I said so in
                        print. All the other newspapers of the country dismissed the book in brief
                        paragraphs, quite as if it had had no distinctive literary quality of its
                        own. But a year or so later the English critics got hold of the novel and
                        wrote of it as a thing of significance and consequence. Thereupon, the
                        American newspapers that had before given it a paragraph or so of
                        insignificant reference, took it up again and reviewed it as a book that
                        meant something, evidently forgetting that they had ever seen it before.</p>
                    <p>This is only one of many incidents of criticism that I might relate in
                        illustration of the hurtful, crippling, paralyzing provincialism that
                        afflicts and obstructs our literary development.</p>
                    <p>A few years ago the principal of a great and very ambitious preparatory
                        school whose function it was to fit young men for college, sent me his
                        curriculum "for criticism," he said,for approval, I interpreted. He set
                        forth quite an elaborate course in what he called "The Literature of the
                        English Language." Upon looking it over I found that not one American book
                        was mentioned in the whole course of it, either as a required study or as
                        "collateral reading"a title under which a multitude of second- or third-rate
                        English works were set down.</p>
                    <p>For criticism I suggested that to the American boy who was expected to become
                        an American man of culture, some slight acquaintance with Irving, Hawthorne,
                        Emerson, Motley, Prescott, Longfellow, Holmes, Whittier, Poe, Parkman,
                        Lowell, Mark Twain, Mr. Howells, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, Paul Hayne, Sidney
                        Lanier, James Whitcomb Riley, Bret Harte, John Hay, and some other American
                            <pb id="VAA2427-280" n="271"/> writers might really be of greater
                        advantage than familiarity with many of the English authors named.</p>
                    <p>His answer was conclusive and profoundly discouraging. It was his function,
                        he said, to prepare boys for their entrance examinations in our great
                        colleges and universities, "and not one of these," he added, "names an
                        American author in its requirement list."</p>
                    <p>I believe the colleges have since that time recognized American literature in
                        some small degree, at least, though meagerly and with no adequate
                        recognition of the fact that a nation's literature is the voice with which
                        it speaks not only to other countries and to posterity but to its own people
                        in its own time, and that acquaintance with it ministers, as no other
                        scholarship does, to good, helpful, patriotic citizenship.</p>
                    <p>One of the English writers who came to this country possibly for his own
                        country's good, gave me some trouble. I was editing <hi rend="i">Hearth and
                            Home</hi> at the time, and he brought me for sale a number of unusually
                        good things, mainly referring to matters French and Italian. He was absolute
                        master of the languages of both those countries, and his acquaintance with
                        their literature, classical, medieval, and modern, was so minute that he
                        knew precisely where to find any literary matter that seemed salable. With a
                        thrift admirable in itself, though misdirected, it was his practice to go to
                        the Astor Library, find what he wanted in rare books or precious foreign
                        newspaper files, translate it, and then tear out and destroy the pages he
                        had plundered. In that irregular fashion he made quite a literary reputation
                        for himself, though after detection he had to retire to Philadelphia, under
                        the orders of Mr. Saunders, Librarian of the Astor Library, who decreed
                        banishment for him as the alternative of prosecution for the mutilation of
                        books.</p>
                    <p>He carried the thing so far, at last, that I regarded it <pb id="VAA2427-281"
                            n="272"/> as my duty to expose him, and I did so in my capacity as
                        literary editor of the <hi rend="i">Evening Post.</hi> I was instantly
                        threatened with a libel suit, but the man who was to bring it left at once
                        on a yachting trip to the West Indies, and so far as I can learn has never
                        reappeared either in America or in literature. It is one of the abiding
                        regrets of my life that the papers in that libel suit were never served upon
                        me.</p>

                    <head>LXI</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the autumn of 1882 a little group of literary men,
                        assembled around Richard Watson Gilder's fireside, decided to organize an
                        Authors Club in New York. They arranged for the drafting of a tentative
                        constitution and issued invitations for twenty-five of us to meet a little
                        later at Lawrence Hutton's house in Thirty-fourth Street to organize the
                        club.</p>
                    <p>We met there on the 13th of November and, clause by clause, adopted a
                        constitution.</p>
                    <p>It was obvious in that little assemblage itself, that some such organization
                        of authors was badly needed in New York. For, though there were only
                        twenty-five of us there, all selected by the originating company, every man
                        of us had to be introduced to some at least of the others present. The men
                        of letters in New York did not know each other. They were beset by
                        unacquaintance, prejudices, senseless antagonisms, jealousies, amounting in
                        some cases to hatreds. They had need to be drawn together in a friendly
                        organization, in which they could learn to know and like and appreciate each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>So great were the jealousies and ambitions to which I have referred, that
                        early in the meeting Mr. GilderI think it was hecalled three or four of us
                        into a corner <pb id="VAA2427-282" n="273"/> and suggested that there was
                        likely to be a fight for the presidency of the club, and that it might
                        result in the defeat of the entire enterprise. At Mr. Gilder's suggestion,
                        or that of some one elseI cannot be sure because all of us in that corner
                        were in accordit was decided that there should be no president of the club,
                        that the government should be vested in an executive council, and that at
                        each of its meetings the council should choose its own chairman. In later
                        and more harmonious years, since the men of the club have become an
                        affectionate brotherhood, it has been the custom for the council to elect
                        its chairman for a year, and usually to relect him for another year. But at
                        the beginning we had conditions to guard against that no longer existnow
                        that the literary men of New York know and mightily like each other.</p>
                    <p>The eligibility clause of the constitution as experimentally drawn up by the
                        committee, prescribed that in order to be eligible a man must be the author
                        of "at least one book proper to literature," orand there followed a clause
                        covering the case of magazine editors and the like.</p>
                    <p>As a reader for a publishing house, I scented danger here. Half in play, but
                        in earnest also. I suggested that the authorship of at least one book proper
                        to literature would render pretty nearly the entire adult male population of
                        the United States eligible to membership in the club, unless some
                        requirement of publication were added. My manuscript reading had seemed to
                        me at least to suggest that, and, as a necessary safeguard, I moved to
                        insert the word "published" before the word "book," and the motion was
                        carried with the laughter of the knowing for its accompaniment.</p>
                    <p>The club was very modest in its beginnings. As its constituent members were
                        mainly persons possessed of no <pb id="VAA2427-283" n="274"/> money, so the
                        club had none. For a time our meetings were held at the houses of
                        membersLawrence Hutton's, Dr. Youmans's, Richard Grant White's, and so on.
                        But as not all of us were possessed of homes that lent themselves to such
                        entertainment, we presently began meeting at Sieghortner's and other
                        restaurants. Then came a most hospitable invitation from the Tile Club,
                        offering us the use of their quarters for our meetings. Their quarters
                        consisted, in fact, of a kitchen in the interior of a block far down townI
                        forget the number of the street. The building served Edwin A. Abbey as a
                        studiohe had not made his reputation as an artist thenand the good old
                        Irishwoman who cared for the rooms lived above stairs with her daughter for
                        her sole companion. This daughter was Abbey's model, and a portrait of her,
                        painted by his hand, hung in the studio, with a presentation legend
                        attached. The portrait represented one of the most beautiful girls I have
                        ever seen. It was positively ravishing in its perfection. One day I had
                        occasion to visit the place to make some club arrangement, and while there I
                        met the young lady of the portrait. She was of sandy complexion, freckled,
                        and otherwise commonplace in an extreme degree. Yet that exquisitely
                        beautiful portrait that hung there in its frame was an admirably faithful
                        likeness of the girl, when one studied the two faces closely. Abbey had not
                        painted in the freckles; he had chosen flesh tints of a more attractive sort
                        than the sandiness of the girl's complexion; he had put a touch of warmth
                        into the indeterminate color of her pale red hair; and above all, he had
                        painted intelligence and soul into her vacuous countenance. Yet the girl and
                        the portrait were absolutely alike in every physical detail.</p>
                    <p>I have not wondered since to learn that the husbands of high-born English
                        dames, and the fathers of English maidens have been glad to pay Abbey kings'
                        ransoms for <pb id="VAA2427-284" n="275"/> portraits of their womankind.
                        Abbey has the gift of interpretation, and I do not know of any greater
                        gift.</p>
                    <p>The rear building in which we met by virtue of the Tile Club's hospitality
                        was approached through an alleyway, or covered gallery rather, concerning
                        which there was a tradition that two suicides and a murder had been
                        committed within its confines.</p>
                    <p>"How inspiring all that is!" said John Hay one night after the traditions had
                        been reported in a peculiarly prosaic fashion by a writer of learned essays
                        in psychology and the like, who had no more imagination than an oyster
                        brings to bear upon the tray on which it is served. "It makes one long to
                        write romantic tragedies, and lurid dramas, and all that sort of thing," Mr.
                        Hay went on. "I'm sorely tempted to enter upon the career of the dime
                        novelist."</p>
                    <p>This set us talking of the dime novel, a little group of us assembled in
                        front of the fire. Some one started the talk by saying that the dime novel
                        was an entirely innocent and a very necessary form of literature. There John
                        Hay broke in, and Edwin Booth, who was also present, sustained him.</p>
                    <p>"The dime novel," Mr. Hay said, " is only a rude form of the story of
                        adventure. If Scott's novels had been sufficiently condensed to be sold at
                        the price, they would have been dime novels of the most successful sort.
                        Your boy wants thrill, heroics, tall talk, and deeds of derring-do, and
                        these are what the dime novelist gives him in abundance, and even in lavish
                        superabundance. I remember that the favorite book of my own boyhood was J.
                        B. Jones's 'Wild Western Scenes.' His 'Sneak' was to me a hero of romance
                        with whom Ivanhoe could in no way compare."</p>
                    <p>"But dime novels corrupt the morals of boys," suggested some one of the
                        company.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-285" n="276"/>
                    <p>"Do they?" asked Mr. Hay. Then a moment later he asked: "Did you ever read
                        one of them?"</p>
                    <p>The interrupter admitted that he had not.</p>
                    <p>"Till you do," said Mr. Hay, "you should hesitate to pass judgment. The moral
                        standards of the dime novel are always of the highest. They are even heroic
                        in their insistence upon honor and self-sacrifice in behalf of the right.
                        They are as chivalric as the code of honor itself. There is never anything
                        unclean in the dime novel, never anything that even squints at toleration of
                        immorality. The man beset by foes is always gallantly supported by resolute
                        fellows with pistols in their hands which they are ready to use in behalf of
                        righteousness. The maiden in trouble has champions galore, whose language
                        may not always square itself with Sunday School standards, but whose
                        devotion to the task of protecting innocence is altogether inspiring."</p>
                    <p>"What about their literary quality?" asked some one in the group.</p>
                    <p>"It is very bad, I suppose," answered Edwin Booth, "but that isn't the
                        quality they put to the front. I have read dozens, scores, hundreds of them,
                        and I have never challenged their literary quality, because that is
                        something to which they lay no claim. Their strength lies in dramatic
                        situations, and they abound in these. I must say that some of them are far
                        better, stronger, and more appealing than are many of those that have made
                        the fortune of successful plays."</p>
                    <p>"Do you read them for the sake of the dramatic situations, Mr. Booth?" some
                        one asked.</p>
                    <p>"No. I read them for the sake of sleep," he replied. "I read them just as I
                        play solitaireto divert my mind and to bring repose to me."</p>

                    <head>LXII</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was not long after that that the Authors Club secured
                        quarters of its own in Twenty-fourth Street, and became an established
                        social organization. For it was never a literary club, but always strictly a
                        social one, having a literary basis of eligibility to membership. From the
                        beginning we refused to read papers at each other, or in any other way to
                        "improve our minds" on club evenings by any form of literary exercise. As
                        the carpenter, who dresses lumber and drives nails and miters joints for his
                        daily bread does not seek his evening recreation by doing those things for
                        amusement, so we who were all hard-working men of letters, earning our
                        living with the pen, had no mind to do as amateurs that which we were daily
                        and hourly doing as professionals.</p>
                    <p>In the same way we decided at the outset to eschew every form of
                        propagandism. The club has had no cause to advocate, no doctrine to
                        promulgate, no "movement" to help or hinder. It has been and still is
                        strictly a social club composed of men of letters, and having for its guests
                        interesting men of all other professions. Hence it has prospered and its
                        members have become intimates with no trace or suggestion of friction
                        between them. I think I am safe in saying that no other organization has
                        done so much for the amelioration of the literary life, the removal of
                        prejudices and bitternesses and spites and jealousies, and for the
                        upbuilding of cordial friendship among writers. I think there is no man in
                        the club who doesn't count every other man there his friend.</p>
                    <p>The point emphasized abovethat the club is a social, not a literary
                        organizationis important. Neglect of it has led to a good deal of
                        ill-informed and misdirected criticism. At the very beginning, on the night
                        of the club's <pb id="VAA2427-287" n="278"/> organization, we made up a list
                        of somewhat more than a score of literary men who should be made members
                        upon the invitation of our Executive Council without the formality of
                        proposal and election. From that list we excludedby unanimous voteone man
                        whose literary work abundantly qualified him for membership, but whose
                        cantankerous self-satisfaction rendered him, in the general opinion, a man
                        not "clubbable." The trouble with him was not so much that he regarded
                        himself, as he once avowed in company that he did, as "a greater than
                        Shakespeare," but that he was disposed to quarrel with everybody who failed
                        to recognize the assumption as a fact.</p>
                    <p>If ours had been a literary club, he must have been admitted to membership
                        without question. As it was a social club, we didn't want him, and three
                        several efforts that he afterwards made to secure admission failed. The like
                        has happened in the cases of two or three other men whose literary work
                        rendered them eligible, but whose personal peculiarities did not commend
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Chiefly, however, the club has been criticised for its failure to admit women
                        to membership. Paul Leicester Ford said to me on that subject one day:</p>
                    <p>"I'll have nothing to do with your club. You arrogantly refuse to admit
                        women, though women are doing quite as much as men in American
                        literature."</p>
                    <p>I explained several things to him. I reminded him that the Authors Club set
                        up no pretension to be completely representative of American literary
                        activity; that it was merely a club formed by gentlemen who felt the need of
                        it, for the purpose of bringing literary men together for social intercourse
                        over their pipes and sandwiches; that the admission of women would of
                        necessity defeat this solitary purpose, and that their exclusion was no more
                        a slight than that which he put upon his nearest friends whenever he gave a
                        dinner or a theater party to which <pb id="VAA2427-288" n="279"/> he could
                        not invite everybody on his eligible list. Then I pointed out another
                        difficulty and a supreme one. If we should admit women on the same terms of
                        eligibility that we insisted upon in the case of men, a host of writing
                        women would become eligible, while our own wives and daughters would in most
                        cases be ineligible. If, in order to cover that difficulty we should admit
                        the wives and daughters of male members, we should be obliged to admit also
                        the husbands, sons, and fathers of our female members, so that presently we
                        should become a mob of men and women, half or more of whom were ineligible
                        under our original conception of the club and its reason for being. There is
                        also the consideration that every club must and does exclude more than it
                        includes; that in requiring New England birth or descent for membership, the
                        New England Society excludes perhaps nine-tenths of the people of New York,
                        while without that requirement the Society would lose its distinctive
                        character and be no New England Society at all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ford was so far convinced that he authorized me to propose his name for
                        membership, but before I had opportunity to do so, the tragedy that ended
                        his life had befallen.</p>
                    <p>The club has found ways of marking its appreciation of the literary equality
                        of women without destroying its own essential being. In February and March
                        of each year it gives four afternoon receptions to women. In so far as it
                        can find them out, the club's Executive Council invites to all of these
                        receptions, besides the wives and daughters of its own members, every woman
                        in the land whose literary work would render her eligible to membership if
                        she were a man. In addition to this, every member of the club has the
                        privilege of inviting any other women he pleases.</p>
                    <p>I do not think the club is deficient in gallantry, nor <pb id="VAA2427-289"
                            n="280"/> do I find any such thought prevalent among the pleasing throng
                        of gentlewomen who honor us by accepting our invitations.</p>
                    <p>Our first quarters were meagerly furnished, of course. It took every dollar
                        we had to furnish them even in the plainest way. There was neither a sofa
                        nor an upholstered chair in our rooms. Cheap, straight-backed, caneseated
                        chairs alone were there. One night when General Sherman was a guest, some
                        one apologized for our inability to offer him a more comfortable seat. The
                        sturdy old soldier always had an opinion ready made to suit every
                        emergency.</p>
                    <p>"Comfortable?" he responded. "Why, what do you call these chairs if they are
                        not comfortable? I don't believe in cushions. They are unnatural; they are
                        devices of self-indulgence and luxury. The law ought to forbid their
                        existence. They make men limp and flabby when they ought to be strong and
                        vigorous and virile. The best chair in the world is one with a raw bull's
                        hide for a seat, and with leathern thongs to tighten it with when it
                        stretches. Next best is the old-fashioned, wooden-bottomed kitchen chair
                        that cost forty cents when I was a boy. I don't suppose they make 'em now.
                        People are too luxurious to know when they are well off."</p>
                    <p>Presently some one spoke to him of his "March to the Sea," and he instantly
                        replied:</p>
                    <p>"It's all romantic nonsense to call it that. The thing was nothing more nor
                        less than a military change of basea thing familiar to every student of
                        tactics; but a poet got hold of it, nicknamed it the 'March to the Sea," and
                        that's what everybody will call it, I suppose, till the crack of doom,
                        unless it is forgotten before that time."</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the hard-fighting veteran's appreciation of the romantic aspect of
                        great achievements was less keen than <pb id="VAA2427-290" n="281"/> that of
                        a company of creative writers. Perhaps his modesty got the better of
                        him.</p>
                    <p>It happened early in the history of the Authors Club that the regular meeting
                        night fell one year on the thirty-first of December. At first it was
                        suggested that the date be changed, but some one remembered the old custom
                        of the Methodists who held "Watch Night" meetings, seeing the old year out
                        and the new year in with rejoicing and fervent singing. Why shouldn't we
                        have a "Watch Night" after our own fashion? The suggestion was eagerly
                        accepted. No programme was arranged, no order of exercises planned. Nothing
                        was prearranged except that with friendship and jollity and the telling of
                        stories we should give a farewell to the old year and a welcome to the
                        new.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, Mark Twain was called upon to begin the story telling, and he
                        put formality completely out of countenance at the very outset. Instead of
                        standing as if to address the company, he seized a chair, straddled it, and
                        with his arms folded across its back, proceeded to tell one of the most
                        humorous of all his stories. Frank Stockton followed with his account of the
                        "mislaid corpse" and before the new year had an hour or two of age, there
                        had been related enough of exquisitely humorous incidentreal or fancifulto
                        make the fortune of two or three books of humor.</p>
                    <p>At midnight we turned out the gas and sang a stanza or two of "Auld Lang
                        Syne" by way of farewell to the old year. Then, with lights all ablaze
                        again, we greeted the new year in the familiar "He's a jolly good
                        fellow."</p>
                    <p>Max O'Rell was my guest on one of these occasions, and in one of his later
                        books he gave an account of it. After recording the fact that "at precisely
                        twelve o'clock the lights are turned out," he added a footnote saying in
                        solemn fashion: "A clock is <hi rend="i">borrowed for the occasion."</hi>
                    </p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-291" n="282"/>
                    <p>I saw a good deal of that witty Frenchman during his several visits to
                        America. I wrote an introduction to the American edition of his "John Bull,
                        Jr.," and it served to protect that work with a copyright entry.</p>
                    <p>He never paid me a cent for the service.</p>
                    <p>That was because I refused to accept the remuneration he pressed upon me.</p>
                    <p>I offer that as a jest which he would have appreciated keenly.</p>
                    <p>He was a man of generous mind, whose humor sometimes impressed others as
                        cynical, a judgment that I always regarded as unjust, for the reason that
                        the humorist must be allowed a certain privilege of saying severer things
                        than he really feels, if he is to be a humorist at all. When Max O'Rell says
                        of a certain type of stupid British boy of the "upper class," that he
                        ultimately enters the army and fights his country's enemies, and then adds:
                        "And whether he kills his country's enemy or his country's enemy kills him,
                        his country is equally benefited," he does not really mean what he says. He
                        once confessed to me that he had had an abiding affection for every such
                        boy, but that the temptation to make a jest at his expense was irresistible
                        in the case of a writer whose bread and butter were dependent upon his
                        ability to excite smiles.</p>
                    <p>In the same way, as everybody must have observed, the humor that has made the
                        reputation of many newspaper editors is largely leveled at women in their
                        various relations with men and at the sacred things of life. Much of it
                        would be cruelly unjust if it were seriously meant, as ordinarily it is
                        not.</p>
                    <p>I have sometimes wondered whether the injustice did not outweigh the
                        humorwhether the smile excited by the humor was worth the wound inflicted by
                        the injustice.</p>
                    <p>The professional humorist, whether with pen, pencil, or tongue, is the-victim
                        of a false perspective. He is so <pb id="VAA2427-292" n="283"/> intent upon
                        his quip or quibble or jest, that he loses sight of more serious things. He
                        does not hesitate to sacrifice even truth and justice, or the highest
                        interest of whatever sort, for the sake of "making his point." He perhaps
                        mistakenly believes that his reader or the person studying his caricature
                        will regard his jest lightly and without loss of respect for the more
                        serious things that lie behind. As a matter of fact, this rarely happens.
                        The reader of the jest accepts it as a setting forth of truth, or at any
                        rate is affected by it in some such fashion.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, therefore, I cannot help regarding the confirmed humorist in
                        literature or art as a detrimental force.</p>
                    <p>I do not mean to include in this condemnation such genial literary humorists
                        as Charles Battell Loomis, and Frank R. Stockton, and Charles Dudley Warner,
                        who made things funny merely by looking at them with an intellectual squint
                        that deceived nobody and misled nobody. I refer only to the habitual jokers
                        of the newspapers and the like,men who, for a wage, undertake to make a jest
                        of everything that interests the popular mind, and who, for the sake of
                        their jest, would pervert the Lord's Prayer itself to a humorous purpose.
                        These people lose all sense of propriety, proportion, perspective, and even
                        of morality itself. They make their jests at so much per line, and at all
                        hazards of truth, justice, and intelligence.</p>
                    <p>In literature these mountebanks impress me as detrimental impertinentsin
                        conversation they seem to me nuisances. I cannot forget one occasion on
                        which the late Bishop Potter and a distinguished judge of the Supreme Court
                        were discussing a question of the possibility of helpful reform in a certain
                        direction. There was a humorist presenta man whose sole idea of conversation
                        was sparkle. He insisted upon sparkling. He interrupted <pb id="VAA2427-293"
                            n="284"/> the gravest utterances with his puns or his plays upon words,
                        or his references to humorous things remembered. The thing became so
                        intolerable that some one present slipped his arms into those of the Bishop
                        and the Judge, and led them away with the suggestion that there was a quiet
                        corner in the club where he would like to seat them and hear the rest of
                        their conversation. As they turned their backs on the humorist and moved
                        away, the Bishop asked:</p>
                    <p>"What did you say the name of that mountebank is?"</p>
                    <p>The Judge replied:</p>
                    <p>"I knew at the time. I'm glad to have forgotten it."</p>
                    <p>"It is just as well," answered the Bishop. "There are many things in this
                        life that are better forgotten than remembered."</p>
                    <p>There is one thing worthy of note in connection with the Authors Club. Almost
                        from the hour of its inception it has furnished the country with a very
                        distinguished proportion of its most eminent diplomats and statesmen. To
                        mention only a few: James Russell Lowell, Andrew D. White, David Jayne Hill,
                        William L. Wilson, Carl Schurz, General Horace Porter, John Hay, Theodore
                        Roosevelt, Oscar S. Straus, Edward M. Shepard, and a dozen others easily
                        mentioned, may be cited as illustrations of the extent to which a club of
                        only about I 80 members in all has been drawn upon by the national
                        government for its needs in diplomacy and statesmanship.</p>
                    <p>The Authors Club idea of a watch night meeting has been borrowed by a number
                        of other organizations, but I think in none of them has it become so well
                        recognized an event of the year. At any rate, it throngs our rooms to the
                        point of suffocation on the night of every thirtyfirst of December.</p>
                    <p>Another habit of the club has been for a considerable number of members and
                        guests to linger after its regular <pb id="VAA2427-294" n="285"/> meetings
                        until the small hours of the morning, telling stories or discussing matters
                        of intellectual interest. This has become a feature of the club meetings
                        since Charles Henry Webbbetter known in literature as "John Paul"said one
                        night at two o'clock:</p>
                    <p>"Upon my soul, the Authors Club is one of the very pleasantest places I
                            know<hi rend="i">after</hi> the authors have gone home."</p>
                    <p>Soon after the club took its quarters in Twenty-fourth Street, three of
                        usRossiter Johnson, John D. Champlin, and myselfwere impressed with the need
                        of more funds and better furnishings. We suggested the publication of a
                        unique book, as a means of securing the funds and providing the furnishings.
                        Our plan contemplated a sumptuous volume, in an edition limited to two
                        hundred and fifty-one copiesone for the club, and the rest for sale at one
                        hundred dollars a copy. We proposed that the members of the club should
                        furnish the poems, stories, and essays needed; that each of them should
                        agree never to publish his contribution elsewhere, and that each poem,
                        story, or essay should be signed by its author in pen and ink in each copy
                        of the book.</p>
                    <p>We were met with prompt discouragement on every hand. The older men among the
                        members of the club were confident that we could never secure the papers
                        desired. Our friends among the publishers simply knew in advance and
                        positively, that even if we could make the book, we could never sell it. Mr.
                        Joe Harper offered to bet me a hat that we could never sell twenty-five of
                        the two hundred and fifty copies. I lived to wear that hat and rejoice in
                        it, for we not only made the book"Liber Scriptorum"but we realized something
                        more than twenty thousand dollars on its sale, as a fund with which to
                        provide leather-covered morris chairs, soft rugs, <pb id="VAA2427-295"
                            n="286"/> handsome bookcases, and other luxuries for our friends the
                        doubters to rejoice in.</p>
                    <p>Authors are supposed to be an unbusinesslike set, who do not know enough of
                        affairs to manage their personal finances in a way to save themselves from
                        poverty. Perhaps the judgment is correct. But the Authors Club is the only
                        club I know in New York which has no dollar of debt resting upon it, and has
                        a comfortable balance to its credit in bank.</p>
                    <p>The case is not singular. It has been written of William Pitt that while he
                        was able to extricate the British exchequer from the sorest embarrassment it
                        ever encountered, he could not keep the duns from his own door.</p>

                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">HAD</hi> been operating my little literary shop successfully
                        for three or four years after quitting the <hi rend="i">Evening Post,</hi>
                        when Mr. Parke Godwin came to me to say that he and some friends were about
                        buying a controlling interest in the newspaper called <hi rend="i">The New
                            York Commercial Advertiser,</hi> and that he wanted me to join his
                        staff. I told him I had no desire to return to journalism, that I liked my
                        quiet literary life at home, and that I was managing to make enough out of
                        it to support my family.</p>
                    <p>He replied that at any rate I might undertake the literary editorship of his
                        newspaper; that it would involve no more than a few hours of office
                        attendance in each week, and need not interfere in any way with my literary
                        undertakings of other kinds.</p>
                    <p>I had a very great personal regard for Mr. Godwin; a very great admiration
                        for his character, and an abiding affection for him as a man. When he
                        pressed this proposal upon me, insisting that its acceptance would relieve
                            <pb id="VAA2427-296" n="287"/> him of a burden, I decided to undertake
                        what he wanted. I was the readier to do so for a peculiar reason. In those
                        days pretty nearly all books, American or English, were first offered to the
                        Harpers, and I had to examine them all, either in manuscript, if they were
                        American, or in proof sheets if they were English. Consequently, whether
                        they were published by the Harpers or by some one else, I was thoroughly
                        familiar with them long before they came from the press. I foresaw that it
                        would be easy for me to review them from the acquaintance I already had with
                        their contents.</p>
                    <p>I was resolutely determined not to be drawn again into the newspaper life,
                        but I foresaw no danger of that in making the literary arrangement
                        suggested.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I became literary editor of the <hi rend="i">Commercial
                            Advertiser</hi> under Mr. Godwin's administration as the editor-in-chief
                        of that newspaper. The paper had never been conducted upon the lines he
                        proposed or upon any other well-defined lines, so far as I could discover,
                        and I foresaw that he had a hard task before him. All the reputation the
                        paper had was detrimental rather than helpful. I was eager to help him over
                        the first hurdles in the race, and so, in addition to my literary duties I
                        not only wrote editorials each day, but helped in organizing a news staff
                        that should at least recognize news when it ran up against it in the
                        street.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Godwin was himself editor-in-chief, and the vigor of his utterances made
                        a quick impression. But his managing editor lackedwell, let us say some at
                        least of the qualifications that tend to make a newspaper successful. Mr.
                        Godwin was an exceedingly patient man, but after a while he wearied of the
                        weekly loss the paper was inflicting upon him. In the meanwhile, I
                        discovered that my attention to the newspaper was seriously interfering with
                        my literary work, and that the fifty dollars a week <pb id="VAA2427-297"
                            n="288"/> which the paper paid me did not compensate me for the time I
                        was giving to it at the expense of my other undertakings. I wrote to Mr.
                        Godwin, recommending a very capable young man to take my place, and asking
                        to be released from an engagement that was anything but profitable to
                        me.</p>
                    <p>For reply I had a prompt letter from Mr. Godwin asking me to see him at his
                        home. There he asked and urged me to become managing editor of the paper
                        from that hour forth. He told me he was losing money in large sums upon its
                        conduct, and appealed to me to come to his rescue, urging that he was "too
                        old and too indolent" himself to put life into the enterprise.</p>
                    <p>The question of salary was not mentioned between us. He appealed to me to
                        help him and I stood ready to do so at any sacrifice of personal interest or
                        convenience. But when the board of directors of the corporation met a month
                        later, he moved an adequate salary for me and suggested that it should be
                        dated back to the day on which I had taken control. A certain excessively
                        small economist on the board objected to the dating back on the ground that
                        no bargain had been made to that effect and that he was "constitutionally
                        opposed to the unnecessary squandering of money."</p>
                    <p>Instantly Mr. Godwin said:</p>
                    <p>"The salary arranged for our managing editor is the just reward of the
                        service he is rendering. He has been giving us that service from the hour of
                        his entrance upon office. He is as justly entitled to compensation for that
                        time as for the future. Either the board must pay it or I will pay it out of
                        my own pocket. We are neither beggars nor robbers, and we take nothing that
                        we do not pay for." There spoke the great, honest-minded man that Parke
                        Godwin always was.</p>
                    <p>It was a difficult task I had undertaken. There were <pb id="VAA2427-298"
                            n="289"/> many obstacles in the way. The chief of these was pointed out
                        by Mr. John Bigelow when he said to me:</p>
                    <p>"You're going to make yours a newspaper for the educated classes. It is my
                        opinion that there are already too many newspapers for the educated
                        classes."</p>
                    <p>I am disposed to think the old journalist and statesman had a prophetic
                        vision of the early coming time when success in newspaper editing would be
                        measured by the skill of newspaper proprietors in making their appeal to the
                        uneducated classesto the million instead of the few thousands.</p>
                    <p>A more perplexing difficulty beset me, however. I had a definitely fixed and
                        wholly inadequate sum of money to expend weekly in making the paper, and
                        when I came to look over my payroll I found that the greater part of the sum
                        allowed me went to pay the salaries of some very worthy men, whose capacity
                        to render effective service to a "live" modern newspaper was exceedingly
                        small. I had sore need of the money these men drew every week, with which to
                        employ reporters who could get news and editors who knew how to write. The
                        men in question held their places by virtue of Mr. Godwin's over-generous
                        desire to provide a living for them.</p>
                    <p>I represented the case to him in its nakedness. I told him frankly that
                        whatever he might be personally able to afford, the newspaper's earnings at
                        that time did not justify the maintenance of such a pension roll. Either I
                        must discharge all these men and use the money that went to pay their
                        salaries in a more fruitful way, or I must decline to go on with the task I
                        had undertaken.</p>
                    <p>He solved the problem by calling the board together, resigning his
                        editorship, and making me editor-in-chief, with unrestricted authority.</p>
                    <p>With all the gentleness I could bring to bear I detached the barnacles and
                        freed myself to make a newspaper. I <pb id="VAA2427-299" n="290"/> had the
                        good fortune in all this to have the support of Mr. Godwin's two sons, who
                        were large stockholders in the newspaper, and of Mr. Henry Marquand, who was
                        also the owner of an important interest.</p>
                    <p>I had also the good fortune to secure the services of some reporters and some
                        editorial assistants whose energies and capacities were of the utmost value
                        to me.</p>
                    <p>Many of them are dead nowas, alas! most other persons are with whom I have
                        been closely associated. But those of them who are living have made place
                        and reputation for themselves in a way that justifies the pride I used to
                        feel in their abilities, their energies, and their conscientious devotion to
                        duty when they worked with me.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, as I contemplate the careers of these men, most of whom came to me as
                        "cubs" fresh from college, I am disposed to plume myself not only upon my
                        sagacity in discovering their untried abilities, but also upon the tutelage
                        I gave them in journalism. The eagerness with which other newspapers have
                        since sought them out for important employments, and the rapidity of their
                        promotion on those other newspapers have always been a source of pride to
                        mepride which is not, I think, vainglorious or unduly personal.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the reader will permit me here to pay tribute to those loyal men who
                        so willingly stood by me when the most that I was permitted to pay them was
                        less than onehalfsometimes less than one-third what they might have earned
                        upon other newspapers.</p>
                    <p>Among them was Charles E. Russell, who has since earned high literary place
                        for himself. Another was Timothy Shaler Williams, who has since been lured
                        from literature, for which his gifts were great, to affairs, and who for
                        many years has been president of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. I had
                        Earl D. Berry for my managing editor, and I could have had none more
                        capable.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-300" n="291"/>
                    <p>In the news department were De Francois Folsomdead long years agoEdward Fales
                        Coward, who has since made a distinguished place for himself; Hewitt, the
                        author of Dixey's song, "So English, You Know"; Sidney Strother Logan, one
                        of the shrewdest news explorers I have ever known,dead years ago,
                        unfortunately,and George B. Mallon, who came to me fresh from college and
                        whose work was so good as to confirm my conviction that even in a
                        newspaper's reporting room an educated mind has advantages over mere native
                        shrewdness and an acquaintance with the slang and patter of the time. Mr.
                        Mallon's work was so good, indeed, that I personally assigned him to tasks
                        of peculiar difficulty. The New York <hi rend="i">Sun</hi> has since
                        confirmed my judgment of his ability by making him its city editor, a post
                        that he has held for seven years or more.</p>
                    <p>Another of my "cubs" was Henry Armstrong, whose abilities have since won for
                        him a place on the brilliant editorial writing staff of the <hi rend="i"
                            >Sun</hi>. Still another was Henry Wright, who is now editor-in-chief of
                        the paper on which he "learned his trade,"though the paper has since changed
                        its name to the <hi rend="i">Globe.</hi> Another was Nelson Hirsh, who
                        afterwards became editor of the <hi rend="i">Sunday World.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>On my editorial staff were Henry R. Elliotdead now,James Davis, who carried
                        every detail of a singularly varied scholarship at his finger-tips, ready
                        for instant use, and whose grace as a writer, illuminated as it was by an
                        exquisitely subtle humor, ought to have made him famous, and would have done
                        so, if death had not come to him too soon.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless there were others whom I ought to mention here in grateful
                        remembrance, but the incessant activities of the score and more of years
                        that have elapsed since my association with them ended have obliterated many
                        details <pb id="VAA2427-301" n="292"/> from my memory. Let me say that to
                        all of them I render thanks for loyal and highly intelligent assistance in
                        the difficult task I then had to wrestle with.</p>
                    <p>With a staff like that we were able to get the news and print it, and we did
                        both in a way that attracted attention in other newspaper offices as well as
                        among newspaper readers. With such writers as those mentioned and others,
                        the editorial utterances of the paper attracted an attention that had never
                        before been accorded to them.</p>
                    <p>So far as its books of account gave indication, the <hi rend="i">Commercial
                            Advertiser</hi> had never earned or paid a dividend. At the end of the
                        first year under this new rgime it paid a dividend of fifty per cent. At the
                        end of its second year it paid its stockholders one hundred per cent. The
                        earnings of the third year were wisely expended in the purchase of new
                        presses and machinery. Before the end of the fourth year I had resigned its
                        editorship to become an editorial writer on <hi rend="i">The World.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I intensely enjoyed the work of "making bricks without straw" on the <hi
                            rend="i">Commercial Advertiser</hi>by which I mean that with a staff of
                        one man to ten on the great morning newspapers, and with one dollar to
                        expend where they could squander hundreds, we managed not only to keep step
                        but to lead them in such news-getting enterprises as those incident to the
                        prosecution of the boodle Aldermen and Jake Sharp, the Diss de Barr case,
                        and the other exciting news problems of the time.</p>
                    <p>The strain, however, was heart-breaking, and presently my health gave way
                        under it A leisurely wandering all over this continent restored it somewhat,
                        but upon my return the burden seemed heavier than everespecially the burden
                        of responsibility that made sleep difficult and rest impossible to me.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile, of course, my literary work had been sacrificed to the
                        Moloch of journalism. I had canceled <pb id="VAA2427-302" n="293"/> all my
                        engagements of that sort and severed connections which I had intended to be
                        lifelong. In a word, I had been drawn again into the vortex of that daily
                        journalism, from which I had twice escaped. I was worn, weary, and
                        inexpressibly oppressed by the duties of responsible editorshipa
                        responsibility I had never sought, but one which circumstances had twice
                        thrust upon me.</p>
                    <p>I wonder if the reader can understand or even faintly imagine what all this
                        means. I wonder if I can suggest some shadow of it to his mind. Think of
                        what it means to toil all day in the making of a newspaper, and to feel,
                        when all is done that the result is utterly inadequate. Think of what it
                        means to the weary one to go home with the next day's task upon his mind as
                        a new burden, and with the discouraging consciousness that all he has done
                        on one day's issue is dead so far as the next day is concerned. Think what
                        it means to a sensitive man to feel that upon his discretion, his alertness,
                        his sagacity, depends not only the daily result of a newspaper's
                        publication, but the prosperity or failure of other men's investments of
                        hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
                    <p>For the value of a newspaper depends from day to day upon its conduct. It is
                        a matter of good will. If the editor pleases his constituency, the
                        investment of the owners remains a profitable property. If he displeases
                        that constituency the newspaper has nothing left to sell but its presses and
                        machinery, representing a small fraction of the sum invested in it.</p>
                    <p>That responsibility rested upon me as an incubus. All my life until then I
                        had been able to sleep. Then came sleeplessness of a sort I could not shake
                        off. At my usual hour for going to bed, I was overcome by sleep, but after
                        five minutes on the pillows there came wakefulness. I learned how to fight
                        it, by going to my library and resolutely sitting in the dark until sleep
                        came, but the process <pb id="VAA2427-303" n="294"/> was a painful one and
                        it left me next morning crippled for my day's work.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile, as I have said, I enjoyed my work as I suppose a man
                        condemned to death enjoys the work of writing his "confessions." I enjoyed
                        my very intimate association with Henry Marquand, one of the most
                        companionable men I ever knew, for the reason that his mind was responsive
                        to every thought one might utter, and that there was always a gentle humor
                        in all that he had to say. He had a most comfortable schooner yacht on board
                        which I many times saved my life or my sanity by passing a Sunday outside on
                        blue water, with nothing more important to think of than the cob pipes we
                        smoked as we loafed in our pajamas on the main hatch.</p>
                    <p>Marquand had a habit of inviting brilliant men for his guests, such men as
                        Dr. Halsted, now of Johns Hopkins; Dr. Tuttle, who has since made fame for
                        himself; Dr. Roosevelt, who died a while ago; James Townsend, Dr. William
                        Gilman Thompson, then a comparatively young man but now one of the supreme
                        authorities in medical science, and others of like highly intellectual
                        quality. Now and then there were "ladies present," but they were an
                        infrequent interruption. I don't mean that ungallantly. But rest and women
                        do not usually go together.</p>
                    <p>It was our habit to board the yacht down Staten Island way on Saturday
                        afternoon, sail out to the lightship and back, and anchor in the Horseshoe
                        for dinner and the night. On Sunday we sailed out toward Fire Island or down
                        toward Long Branch, or wherever else we chose. We were intent only upon
                        restthe rest that the sea alone can give, and that only the lovers of the
                        sea ever get in this utterly unrestful world of ours.</p>
                    <p>On deck in the afternoon and evening, and in the saloon at dinner and other
                        meals, we talked, I suppose, of intellectual things. At sea we rested, and
                        smoked, and <pb id="VAA2427-304" n="295"/> were silent, and altogether
                        happy. I have always enjoyed the sea. I have crossed the ocean many times,
                        and I have sailed in all sorts of craft over all sorts of seas, with delight
                        in every breath that the ocean gave to me; but I think I may truly say that
                        no other voyage I ever made gave me so much pleasure as did those little
                        yachting trips on the "Ruth" in company with men whose very presence was an
                        intellectual inspiration.</p>
                    <p>But the most abiding recollection I have of my service on the <hi rend="i"
                            >Commercial Advertiser</hi> is that which concerns itself with Parke
                        Godwin. He was a man of great thought impulses, only half expressed. That
                        which he gave to the world in print was no more than the hem of his
                        intellectual garment. A certain constitutional indolence, encouraged by his
                        too early acquisition of sufficient wealth to free him from the necessity of
                        writing for a living, prevented him from giving to the world the best that
                        was in him. He would have a great thought and he would plan to write it.
                        Sometimes he would even begin to write it. But in the end he preferred to
                        talk it to some appreciative listener.</p>
                    <p>I remember one case of the kind. He had several times invited me to visit him
                        at his Bar Harbor summer home. Always I had been obliged by the exigencies
                        of my editorial work to forego that delight. One summer he wrote to me,
                        saying:</p>
                    <p>"I wonder if you could forget the <hi rend="i">Commercial Advertiser</hi>
                        long enough to spend a fortnight with me here at Bar Harbor. You see, I
                        don't like to issue invitations and have them 'turned down,' so I'm not
                        going to invite you till you write me that you will come."</p>
                    <p>In answer to that invitation I passed a fortnight with him. From beginning to
                        end of the time he forbade all mention of the newspaper of which he was
                        chief owner and I the responsible editor. But during that time he <pb
                            id="VAA2427-305" n="296"/> "talked into me," as he said at parting, a
                        deal of high thinking that he ought to have put into print.</p>
                    <p>His mind had one notable quality in common with Emerson'sthe capacity to
                        fecundate every other mind with which it came into close contact. One came
                        away, from a conference with him, feeling enriched, inspired, enlarged, not
                        so much by the thought he had expressed as by the thinking he had instigated
                        in his listener's mind.</p>
                    <p>It was so with me on that occasion. I came away full of a thought that grew
                        and fruited in my mind. Presentlyan occasion offeringI wrote it into a
                        series of articles in the newspaper. These attracted the attention of Dr.
                        William M. Sloane, now of Columbia University, then professor of history at
                        Princeton and editor of the <hi rend="i">Princeton Review.</hi> At his
                        instigation I presented the same thought in his <hi rend="i">Review</hi>,
                        and a little later by invitation I addressed the Nineteenth Century Club on
                        the subject. I called it "The American Idea." In substance it was that our
                        country had been founded and had grown great upon the idea that every man
                        born into the world has a right to do as he pleases, so long as he does not
                        trespass upon the equal right of any other man to do as he pleases, and that
                        in a free country it is the sole function of government to maintain the
                        conditions of liberty and to let men alone.</p>
                    <p>The idea seemed to be successful in its appeal to men's intelligence at that
                        time, but many years lateronly a year or so ago, in factI put it forward in
                        a commencement address at a Virginia College and found it sharply though
                        silently antagonized by professors and trustees on the ground that it seemed
                        to deny to government the right to enact prohibitory liquor laws, or
                        otherwise to make men moral by statute. The doctrine was pure
                        Jeffersonianism, of course, and the professors and trustees sincerely
                        believed themselves to be Jeffersonians. But the <pb id="VAA2427-306"
                            n="297"/> doctrine had gored their pet ox, and that made a
                        difference.</p>
                    <p>One day Mr. Godwin expressed himself as delighted with all I had written on
                        the American Idea. I responded:</p>
                    <p>"That is very natural. The idea is yours, not mine, and in all that I have
                        written about it, I have merely been reporting what you said to me, as we
                        stood looking at the surf dashing itself to pieces on the rocks at Bar
                        Harbor."</p>
                    <p>"Not at all," he answered. "No man can expound and elaborate another man's
                        thought without putting so much of himself into it as to make it essentially
                        and altogether his own. I may have dropped a seed into your mind, but I
                        didn't know it or intend it. The fruitage is all your own. My thinking on
                        the subject was casual, vagrant, unorganized. I had never formulated it in
                        my own mind. You see we all gather ideas in converse with others. That is
                        what speech was given to man for. But the value of the ideas depends upon
                        the use made of them."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Godwin had been at one time in his life rather intimately associated with
                        Louis Kossuth, the Hungarian patriot and statesman. As all old newspaper men
                        remember, Kossuth had a habit of dying frequently. News of his death would
                        come and all the newspapers would print extended obituary articles. Within a
                        day or two the news would be authoritatively contradicted, and the
                        obituaries would be laid away for use at some future time. On one of these
                        occasions Mr. Godwin wrote for me a singularly interesting article, giving
                        his personal reminiscences of Kossuth. Before I could print it despatches
                        came contradicting the news of the old Hungarian's death. I put Mr. Godwin's
                        manuscript into a pigeonhole and both he and I forgot all about it. A year
                        or so later <pb id="VAA2427-307" n="298"/> Kossuth did in fact die, and in
                        looking through my papers to see what I might have ready for printing on the
                        subject, I discovered Mr. Godwin's paper. It was not signed, but purported
                        to be the personal recollections of one who had known the patriot well.</p>
                    <p>I hurried it into print, thus gaining twelve or fourteen hours on the morning
                        newspapers.</p>
                    <p>The next morning Mr. Godwin called upon me, declaring that he had come face
                        to face with the most extraordinary psychological problem he had ever
                        encountered.</p>
                    <p>"The chapter of Kossuth reminiscences that you printed yesterday," he said,
                        "was as exact a report of my own recollections of the man as I could have
                        given you if you had sent a reporter to interview me on the subject; and the
                        strangest part of it is that the article reports many things which I could
                        have sworn were known only to myself. It is astonishing, inexplicable."</p>
                    <p>"This isn't a case of talking your thought into another person," I answered,
                        referring to the former incident. "This time you put yourself down on paper,
                        and what I printed was set from the manuscript you gave me a year or so
                        ago."</p>
                    <p>This solved the psychological puzzle and to that extent relieved his mind.
                        But there remained the further difficulty that, cudgel his brain as he
                        might, he could find in it no trace of recollection regarding the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>"I remember very well," he said, "that I often thought I ought to write out
                        my recollections of Kossuth, but I can't remember that I ever did so. I
                        remember taking myself to task many times for my indolence in postponing a
                        thing that I knew I ought to do, but that only makes the case the more
                        inexplicable. When I scourged myself for neglecting the task, why didn't my
                        memory remind me that I had actually discharged the duty? And now that I
                        have read the reminiscences in print, why am I <pb id="VAA2427-308" n="299"
                        /> unable to recall the fact that I wrote them? The article fills several
                        columns. Certainly I ought to have some recollection of the labor involved
                        in writing so much. Are you entirely certain that the manuscript was
                        mine?"</p>
                    <p>I sent to the composing room for the "copy" and showed it to him. As he
                        looked it over he said:</p>
                    <p>"'Strange to say, on Club paper.' You remember Thackeray's Roundabout paper
                        with that headline? It has a bearing here, for this is written on paper that
                        the Century Club alone provides for the use of its members. I must,
                        therefore, have written the thing at the Century Club, and that ought to
                        resurrect some memory of it in my mind, but it doesn't. No. I have not the
                        slightest recollection of having put that matter on paper."</p>
                    <p>At that point his wonderfully alert mind turned to another thought.</p>
                    <p>"Suppose you and I believed in the occult, the mystical, the so-called
                        supernatural, as we don't," he said, "what a mystery we might make of this
                        in the way of psychical manifestationwhich usually belongs to the domain of
                        psycho-pathology. Think of it! As I chastised myself in my own mind for my
                        neglect to put these things on paper, your mind came under subjection to
                        mine and you wrote them in my stead. So complete was the possession that
                        your handwriting, which is clear and legible, became an exact facsimile of
                        mine, which is obscure and difficult. Then you, being under possession,
                        preserved no memory of having written the thing, while I, knowing nothing of
                        your unconscious agency in the matter, had nothing to remember concerning
                        it. Isn't that about the way the mysticists make up their 'facts' for the
                        misleading of half-baked brains?"</p>
                    <p>In later years I related this incident to a distinguished half-believer in
                        things mystical, adding Mr. Godwin's <pb id="VAA2427-309" n="300"/>
                        laughingly conjectural explanation of it, whereupon the reply came:</p>
                    <p>"May not that have been the real explanation, in spite of your own and Mr.
                        Godwin's skepticism?"</p>
                    <p>I was left with the feeling that after all what Mr. Godwin had intended as an
                        extravagant caricature was a veritable representation of a credulity that
                        actually exists, even among men commonly accounted sane, and certainly
                        learned. The reflection was discouraging to one who hopes for the progress
                        of mankind through sanity of mind.</p>

                        newspapers of established reputation. There was rivalry among them in their
                        endeavors to publish the earliest news of public events, but it was a
                        dignified rivalry involving comparatively little of that self-glorification
                        which has since come to be a double-leaded feature in the conduct of many
                        newspapers. The era of illustration and exploitation by the use of pictures
                        had not yet been born of cheapened reproductive processes. Newspapers were
                        usually printed directly from type because stercotyping was then a costly
                        process and a slow one. As a consequence, newspapers were printed in regular
                        columns consecutively arranged, and articles begun in one column were
                        carried forward in the next. There were no such legends as "continued on
                        page five," and the like.</p>
                    <p>Headlines were confined to the column that began the article. The art of
                        stretching them halfway or all the way across the page and involving half a

                        and in its absence the use of circus poster type and circus poster
                        exaggeration of phrase was undreamed of.</p>
                    <p>Now and then an advertiser anxious for conspicuity would pay a heavy price to
                        have column rules cut so that his announcement might stretch over two or
                        more columns, but the cost of that was so great that indulgence in it was
                        rare even among ambitious advertisers, while in the reading columns the
                        practice was wholly unknown.</p>
                    <p>Another thing. It was then thought that when a copy of a newspaper was sold,
                        the price paid for it ought to be sufficient at least to pay the cost of its
                        manufacture, plus some small margin of profit. All the great morning
                        newspapers except the <hi rend="i">Sun</hi> were sold at four cents a copy;
                        the <hi rend="i">Sun</hi>, by virtue of extraordinary literary condensation,
                        used only about half the amount of paper consumed by the others, and was
                        sold at two cents. The afternoon newspapers were sold at three cents.</p>
                    <p>The publishers of newspapers had not then grasped the idea that is now
                        dominant, that if a great circulation can be achieved by selling newspapers
                        for less than the mere paper in them costs, the increase in the volume and
                        price of advertising will make of them enormously valuable properties.</p>
                    <p>That idea was not born suddenly. Even after the revolution was established,
                        the cost of the white paper used in making a newspaper helped to determine
                        the price of it to the public. It was not until the phenomenal success of
                        cheap newspapers years afterwards tempted even more reckless adventurers
                        into the field that publishers generally threw the entire burden of
                        profit-making upon the advertising columns and thus established the business
                        office in the seat before occupied by the editor and made business
                        considerations altogether dominant over utterance, attitude, and
                        conduct.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-311" n="302"/>
                    <p>There were in the meantime many attempts made to establish a cheaper form of
                        journalism, but they were inadequately supported by working capital; they
                        were usually conducted by men of small capacity; they had no traditions of
                        good will behind them, and above all, they could not get Associated Press
                        franchises. For the benefit of readers who are not familiar with the facts,
                        I explain that the Associated Press is an organization for newsgathering,
                        formed by the great newspapers by way of securing news that no newspaper
                        could afford to secure for itself. It maintains bureaus in all the great
                        news centers of the world, and these collect and distribute to the
                        newspapers concerned a great mass of routine news that would be otherwise
                        inaccessible to them. If a president's message, or an inaugural address, or
                        any other public document of voluminous character is to be given out, it is
                        obvious that the newspapers concerned cannot wait for telegraphic reports of
                        its contents. By way of saving time and telegraphic expense, the document is
                        delivered to the Associated Press, and copies of it are sent to all the
                        newspapers concerned, with a strict limitation upon the hour of its
                        publication. Until that hour comes no newspaper in the association is
                        privileged to print it or in any way, by reference or otherwise, to reveal
                        any part of its contents. But in the meanwhile they can put it into type,
                        and with it their editorial comments upon it, so that when the hour of
                        release comes, they can print the whole thingtext and commentwithout loss of
                        time. The newspaper not endowed with an Associated Press franchise must wait
                        for twenty-four hours or more for its copy of the document.</p>
                    <p>Hardly less important is the fact that in every city, town, and village in
                        the country, the Associated Press has its agentthe local editor or the
                        telegraph operator, or some one elsewho is commissioned to report to it <pb
                            id="VAA2427-312" n="303"/> every news happening that may arise within
                        his bailiwick. Often these reports are interesting; sometimes they are of
                        importance, and in either case the newspaper not allied with a press
                        association must miss them.</p>
                    <p>At the time of which I am writing, the Associated Press was the only
                        organization in the country that could render such service, and every
                        newspaper venture lacking its franchise was foredoomed to failure.</p>
                    <p>But a newspaper revolution was impending and presently it broke upon us.</p>
                    <p>In 1883 Mr. Joseph Pulitzer bought the <hi rend="i">World</hi> and instituted
                        a totally new system of newspaper conduct.</p>
                    <p>His advent into New York journalism was called an "irruption," and it was
                        resented not only by the other newspapers, but even more by a large
                        proportion of the conservative public.</p>
                    <p>In its fundamental principle, Mr. Pulitzer's revolutionary method was based
                        upon an idea identical with that suggested by Mr. John Bigelow when he told
                        me there were too many newspapers for the educated class. Mr. Pulitzer
                        undertook to make a newspaper, not for the educated class, but for all sorts
                        and conditions of men. He did not intend to overlook the educated class, but
                        he saw clearly how small a part of the community it was, and he refused to
                        make his appeal to it exclusively or even chiefly.</p>
                    <p>The results were instantaneous and startling. The <hi rend="i">World</hi>,
                        which had never been able to achieve a paying circulation or a paying
                        constituency of advertisers, suddenly began selling in phenomenal numbers,
                        while its advertising business became what Mr. Pulitzer once called a
                        "bewildering chaos of success, yielding a revenue that the business office
                        was imperfectly equipped to handle."</p>
                    <p>It is an interesting fact, that the <hi rend="i">World's</hi> gain in
                        circulation was not made at the expense of any other newspaper. <pb
                            id="VAA2427-313" n="304"/> The books of account show clearly that while
                        the <hi rend="i">World</hi> was gaining circulation by scores and hundreds
                        of thousands, no other morning newspaper was losing. The simple fact was
                        that by appealing to a larger class, the <hi rend="i">World</hi> had created
                        a great company of newspaper readers who had not before been newspaper
                        readers at all. Reluctantly, and only by degrees, the other morning
                        newspapers adopted the <hi rend="i">World's</hi> methods, and won to
                        themselves a larger constituency than they had ever enjoyed before.</p>
                    <p>All this had little effect upon the afternoon newspapers. They had their
                        constituencies. Their province was quite apart from that of the morning
                        papers. A circulation of ten or twenty thousand copies seemed to them
                        satisfactory; any greater circulation was deemed extraordinary, and if at a
                        time of popular excitement their sales exceeded twenty thousand they
                        regarded it not only as phenomenal but as a strain upon their printing and
                        distributing machinery which it would be undesirable to repeat very
                        often.</p>
                    <p>But the revolution was destined to reach them presently. At that time none of
                        the morning newspapers thought of issuing afternoon editions. The game
                        seemed not worth the candle. But presently the sagacity of Mr. William M.
                        Laffanthen a subordinate on the <hi rend="i">Sun's</hi> staff, later the
                        proprietor and editor of that newspapersaw and seized an opportunity. The
                        morning papers had learned their lesson and were making their appeal to the
                        multitude instead of the select few. The afternoon newspapers were still
                        addressing themselves solely to "the educated class." Mr. Laffan decided to
                        make an afternoon appeal to the more multitudinous audience. Under his
                        inspiration the <hi rend="i">Evening Sun</hi> was established on the
                        seventeenth day of March, 1887, and it instantly achieved a circulation of
                        forty thousandfrom twice to four times that of its more conservative
                        competitors.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-314" n="305"/>
                    <p>A little later an evening edition of the <hi rend="i">World</hi> was
                        established. Its success at first was small, but Mr. Pulitzer quickly saw
                        the reason for that. The paper was too closely modeled upon the conservative
                        and dignified pattern of the established afternoon newspapers. To his
                        subordinates Mr. Pulitzer said:</p>
                    <p>"You are making a three-cent newspaper for a one-cent constituency. I want
                        you to make it a one-cent newspaper."</p>
                    <p>What further instructions he gave to that end, I have never heard, but
                        whatever they were they were carried out with a success that seemed to me to
                        threaten the very existence of such newspapers as the one I was editing. I
                        was satisfied that if the newspaper under my control was to survive it must
                        adopt the new methods of journalism, broaden its appeal to the people, and
                        reduce its price to the "penny" which alone the people could be expected to
                        pay when the <hi rend="i">Evening Sun</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Evening
                            World</hi> could be had for that price.</p>
                    <p>The board of directors of the newspaper could not be induced to take this
                        view, and just then one of the editors of the <hi rend="i">World</hi>,
                        acting for Mr. Pulitzer, asked me to take luncheon with him. He explained to
                        me that Mr. Pulitzer wanted an editorial writer and that hemy hosthad been
                        commissioned to engage me in that capacity, if I was open to engagement. In
                        the end he made me a proposal which I could not put aside in justice to
                        myself and my family. My relations with Mr. Godwin and his associates were
                        so cordial, and their treatment of me had been always so generous, that I
                        could not think of leaving them without their hearty consent and approval.
                        The summer was approaching, when the members of the board of directors would
                        go away to their summer homes or to Europe. The last regular meeting of the
                        board for the season had been held, and nothing had been done to meet <pb
                            id="VAA2427-315" n="306"/> the new conditions of competition. I was
                        discouraged by the prospect of addressing a steadily diminishing audience
                        throughout the summer, with the possibility of having no audience at all to
                        address when the fall should come.</p>
                    <p>I hastily called the board together in a special meeting. I told them of the
                        proposal made to me by the <hi rend="i">World</hi> and of my desire to
                        accept it unless they could be induced to let me adopt the new methods at an
                        expense much greater than any of the established afternoon newspapers had
                        ever contemplated, and much greater than my board of directors was willing
                        to contemplate. I said frankly that without their cordial consent, I could
                        not quit their service, but that if we were to go on as before, I earnestly
                        wished to be released from a responsibility that threatened my health with
                        disaster.</p>
                    <p>They decided to release me, after passing some very flattering resolutions,
                        and in early June, 1889, I went to the <hi rend="i">World</hi> as an
                        editorial writer free from all responsibility for the news management of the
                        paper, free from all problems of newspaper finance, and free from the
                        crushing weight of the thought that other men's property interests to the
                        extent of many hundreds of thousands of dollars were in hourly danger of
                        destruction by some fault or failure of judgment on my part. As I rejoiced
                        in this sense of release, I recalled what James R. Osgood, one of the
                        princes among publishers, had once said to me, and for the first time I
                        fully grasped his meaning. At some public banquet or other he and I were
                        seated side by side and we fell into conversation regarding certain books he
                        had published. They were altogether worthy books, but their appeal seemed to
                        me to be to so small a constituency that I could not understand what had
                        induced him to publish them at all. I said to him:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-316" n="307"/>
                    <p>"I sometimes wonder at your courage in putting your money into the
                        publication of such books."</p>
                    <p>He answered:</p>
                    <p>"That's the smallest part of the matter. Think of my courage in putting <hi
                            rend="i">other people's money</hi> into their publication!"</p>
                    <p>It was not long after that that Osgood's enterprises failed, and he retired
                        from business as a publisher to the sorrow of every American who in any way
                        cared for literature.</p>
                    <p>When Osgood went to London as an agent of the Harpers, some of us gave him a
                        farewell dinner, for which Thomas Nast designed the menu cards. When these
                        were passed around for souvenir autographs, Edwin A. Abbey drew upon each,
                        in connection with his signature, a caricature of himself which revealed new
                        possibilities in his geniuspossibilities that have come to nothing simply
                        because Mr. Abbey has found a better use for his gifts than any that the
                        caricaturist can hope for. But those of us who were present at that little
                        Osgood dinner still cherish our copies of the dinner card on which, with a
                        few strokes of his pencil, Abbey revealed an unsuspected aspect of his
                        genius. In view of the greatness of his more serious work, we rejoice that
                        he went no further than an after-dinner jest, in the exercise of his gift of
                        caricature. Had he given comic direction to his work, he might have become a
                        Hogarth, perhaps; as it is, he is something far better worth whilehe is
                        Abbey.</p>

                        were too closely personal, too intimate, and in many ways too confidential
                        to serve a purpose of that kind.</p>
                    <p>But of the men with whom my work on the <hi rend="i">World</hi> brought me

                        relate certain dramatic happenings that serve to illustrate the Napoleonic
                        methods of modern journalism and certain other things, not of a confidential
                        nature, which throw light upon the character, impulses, and methods of the
                        man whose genius first discovered the possibilities of journalism and whose
                        courage, energy, and extraordinary sagacity have made of those possibilities

                        begin counting up the men now dead who were my fellow-workmen there.</p>
                    <p>I did not personally know Mr. Pulitzer when I began my duties on the <hi
                            rend="i">World</hi>. He was living in Europe then, and about to start on
                        a long yachting cruise. John A. Cockerill was managing editor and in control
                        of the paper, subject, of course, to daily and sometimes hourly instructions
                        from Paris by cable. For, during my eleven years of service on the <hi
                            rend="i">World</hi>, I never knew the time when Mr. Pulitzer did not
                        himself actively direct the conduct of his paper wherever he might be. Even
                        when he made a yachting voyage as far as the East Indies, his hand remained
                        always on the helm in New York.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Cockerill was one of the kindliest, gentlest of men, and at the same
                        time one of the most irascible. His irascibility was like the froth that
                        rises to the top of the glass and quickly disappears, when a Seidlitz powder
                        is dissolvednot at all like the "head" on a glass of champagne which goes on
                        threateningly rising long after the first effervescence is gone. When
                        anything irritated him <pb id="VAA2427-318" n="309"/> the impulse to break
                        out into intemperate speech seemed wholly irresistible, but in the very
                        midst of such utterance the irritation would pass away as suddenly as it had
                        come and he would become again the kindly comrade he had meant to be all the
                        while. This was due to the saving grace of his sense of humor. I think I
                        never knew a man so capable as he of intense seriousness, who was at the
                        same time so alertly and irresistibly impelled to see the humorous aspects
                        of things. He would rail violently at an interfering circumstance, but in
                        the midst of his vituperation he would suddenly see something ridiculous
                        about it or in his own ill-temper concerning it. He would laugh at the
                        suggestion in his mind, laugh at himself, and tell some brief anecdoteof
                        which his quiver was always fullby way of turning his own irritation and
                        indignation into fun and thus making an end of them.</p>
                    <p>He was an entire stranger to me when I joined the staff of the <hi rend="i"
                            >World</hi>, but we soon became comrades and friends. There was so much
                        of robust manhood in his nature, so much of courage, kindliness, and
                        generous good will that in spite of the radical differences between his
                        conceptions of life and mine, we soon learned to find pleasure in each
                        other's company, to like each other, and above all, to trust each other. I
                        think each of us recognized in the other a man incapable of lying, deceit,
                        treachery, or any other form of cowardice. That he was such a man I
                        perfectly knew. That he regarded me as such I have every reason to
                        believe.</p>
                    <p>After our friendship was perfectly established he said to me one day:</p>
                    <p>"You know I did all I could to prevent your engagement on the <hi rend="i"
                            >World</hi>. I'm glad now I didn't succeed."</p>
                    <p>"What was your special objection to me?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"Misconception, pure and simple, together with ill-informed prejudice. That's
                        tautological, of course, for <pb id="VAA2427-319" n="310"/> prejudice is
                        always ill-informed, isn't it? At any rate, I had an impression that you
                        were a man as utterly different from what I now know you to be as one can
                        easily imagine."</p>
                    <p>"And yet," I said, "you generously helped me out of my first difficulty
                        here."</p>
                    <p>"No, did I? How was that?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, when the news went out that I had been engaged as an editorial writer
                        on the <hi rend="i">World</hi>, a good many newspapers over the country were
                        curious to know why. The prejudice against the <hi rend="i">World</hi> under
                        its new management was still rampant, and my appointment seemed to many
                        newspapers a mystery, for the reason that my work before that time had
                        always been done on newspapers of a very different kind. Even here on the
                            <hi rend="i">World</hi> there was curiosity on the subject, for Ballard
                        Smith sent a reporter to me, before I left the <hi rend="i">Commercial
                            Advertiser</hi>, to ask me about it. The reporter, under instructions,
                        even asked me, flatly, whose place I was to take on the <hi rend="i"
                            >World</hi>, as if the <hi rend="i">World</hi> had not been able to
                        employ a new man without discharging an old one."</p>
                    <p>"YesI know all about that," said Cockerill. "You see, you were
                        editor-in-chief of a newspaper, and some of the folks on the <hi rend="i"
                            >World</hi> had a hope born into their minds that you were coming here
                        to replace me as managing editor. Some others feared you were coming to oust
                        them from snug berths. Go on. You didn't finish."</p>
                    <p>"Well, among the speculative comments made about my transfer, there was one
                        in a Springfield paper, suggesting that perhaps I had been employed 'to give
                        the <hi rend="i">World</hi> a conscience.' All these things troubled me
                        greatly, for the reason that I didn't know Mr. Pulitzer then, nor he me, and
                        I feared he would suspect me of having inspired the utterances in
                        questionparticularly the one last mentioned. I went to you with my trouble,
                            <pb id="VAA2427-320" n="311"/> and I shall never forget what you said to
                        me. 'My dear Mr. Eggleston, you can trust Joseph Pulitzer to get to windward
                        of things without any help from me or anybody else.'"</p>
                    <p>"You've found it so since, haven't you ?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, but I didn't know it then, and it was a kindly act on your part to
                        reassure me."</p>
                    <p>Cockerill's abilities as a newspaper editor were very great, but they were
                        mainly executive. He had no great creative imagination. He could never have
                        originated the Napoleonic revolution in journalism which Mr. Pulitzer's
                        extraordinary genius wrought. But Mr. Pulitzer was fortunate in having such
                        a man as Cockerill to carry out his plans. His alert readiness in grasping
                        an idea and translating it into achievement amounted to genius in its way.
                        But during all the years of my intimate association with him, I never knew
                        Cockerill to originate a great idea. With a great idea intrusted to him for
                        execution, his brain was fertile of suggestions and expedients for its
                        carrying out, and his industry in translating the ideas of his chief into
                        action was ceaseless, tireless, sleepless. He would think of a thousand
                        devices for accomplishing the purpose intended. He would hit upon scores of
                        ways in which a campaign projected by another mind could be carried out
                        effectively.</p>
                    <p>There was at one time a good deal of speculation as to whose brain had made
                        the phenomenal success of the all-daring <hi rend="i">World</hi> experiment
                        in journalism. I think I know all about that, and my judgment is
                        unhesitating. Mr. Pulitzer was often and even generally fortunate in his
                        multitudinous lieutenants, and that good fortune was chiefly due to his
                        sagacity in the selection of the men appointed to carry out his plans. But
                        the plans were his, just as the choice of lieutenants was, and the creative
                        genius that revolutionized journalism and achieved results <pb
                            id="VAA2427-321" n="312"/> unmatched and even unapproached, was
                        exclusively that of Joseph Pulitzer.</p>
                    <p>I do not mean that every valuable idea or suggestion which contributed to the
                        result was originally his, though on broad lines that was true. But it was
                        part and parcel of his genius to induce ideas and call forth suggestions at
                        the hands of others, to make them his own, and to embody them in the policy
                        of the <hi rend="i">World</hi>. So readily did he himself appreciate this
                        necessity of getting ideas from whatever source they might come, that he
                        often offered premiums and rewards for helpful suggestions. And when any
                        member of his staff voluntarily offered suggestions that appealed to him, he
                        was always ready and very generous in acknowledging and rewarding them.</p>
                    <p>But it was Joseph Pulitzer's genius that conceived the new journalism; it was
                        his brain that gave birth to it all; it was his gift of interpreting,
                        utilizing, and carrying out the ideas of others that made them fruitful.</p>
                    <p>I emphasize this judgment here because there has been much misapprehension
                        regarding it, and because I knew the facts more intimately and more
                        definitely perhaps than any other person now living does. I feel myself free
                        to write of the subject for the reason that it has been more than a decade
                        of years since my connection with the <hi rend="i">World</hi> ceased, and
                        the personal friendship I once enjoyed with Mr. Pulitzer became a matter of
                        mere reminiscence to both of us.</p>
                    <p>My relations with Cockerill were not embarrassed by any question of control
                        or authority. Cockerill had general charge of the newspaper, but the
                        editorial page was segregated from the other sheets, and so far as that was
                        concerned, William H. Merrill was in supreme authority. Whenever he was
                        absent his authority devolved upon me, and for results I was answerable only
                        to Mr. Pulitzer.</p>
                    <p>I shall never forget my introduction to my new duties. <pb id="VAA2427-322"
                            n="313"/> It was arranged between Merrill and me, that I should take a
                        week off, between the severance of my connection with the <hi rend="i"
                            >Commercial Advertiser</hi> and the beginning of my work on the <hi
                            rend="i">World</hi>, in order that I might visit my family and rest
                        myself at my little place on Lake George. I was to report for duty on the
                            <hi rend="i">World</hi> on a Sunday morning, when Merrill would induct
                        me into the methods of the newspaper, preparatory to his vacation, beginning
                        two or three days later.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, Merrill had greater confidence in my newspaper skill and
                        experience than I had, and so when I reported for duty on Sunday, Merrill
                        was already gone on his vacation and I was left responsible for next day's
                        editorial page.</p>
                    <p>I knew nothing of the <hi rend="i">World's</hi> staff or organization or
                        methods. There were no other editorial writers present in the office and
                        upon inquiry of the office boys I learned that no others were expected to
                        present themselves on that day.</p>
                    <p>I sent to the foreman of the composing room for the "overproofs"that is to
                        say, proofs of editorial matter left over from the day before. He reported
                        that there were none, for the reason that Merrill, before leaving on the
                        preceding day, had "killed" every editorial galley in the office.</p>
                    <p>Cockerill was not expected at the office until nine or ten o'clock that
                        night, and there was nobody else there who could tell me anything about the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, there was only one thing to do. I sat down and wrote an entire
                        editorial page, for a newspaper whose methods and policy I knew only from
                        the outside. When I had done that, and had got my matter into type, and had
                        read my revised proofs, messengers arrived bearing the manuscripts of what
                        the other editorial writersmen unknown to mehad written at their homes
                        during the <pb id="VAA2427-323" n="314"/> day, after the Sunday custom that
                        then prevailed but which I abolished a little later when Merrill went to
                        Europe upon Mr. Pulitzer's invitation and I was left in control of the
                        editorial page.</p>
                    <p>I have related this experience thinking that it may interest readers
                        unfamiliar with newspaper work, as an exemplification of the emergency
                        problems with which newspaper men have often to deal. These are of frequent
                        occurrence and of every conceivable variety. I remember that once some great
                        utterance seemed necessary, and Mr. Pulitzer telegraphed it from Bar Harbor.
                        It filled the entire available editorial space, so that I provided no other
                        editorial articles whatever. I had " made up " the page and was only waiting
                        for time before going home, when news despatches came that so completely
                        changed the situation treated in the editorial as to compel its
                        withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>It was after midnight, and I hadn't a line of editorial matter on the galleys
                        with which to fill the void. The editorial page must go to the stereotypers
                        at half-past one, and I had no soul to help me even by writing twaddle with
                        which to fill space. The situation was imperative and the case was clear.
                        The case was that I must write two or three columns of editorial matter and
                        get it into type, proof-read, and corrected, before one-thirty of the
                        clockor one-forty-five, as the foreman of the composing room, a royal good
                        fellow, Mr. Jackson, volunteered to stretch the time limit by some ingenious
                        device of his own.</p>
                    <p>I wish to say here, lest no other opportunity offer, that in the thirty years
                        of my newspaper service, I have found no better or more loyal friends than
                        the men of the composing room, whether in high place or low; that I have
                        never known them to hesitate, in an emergency, to help out by specially
                        strenuous endeavor and by enduring great <pb id="VAA2427-324" n="315"/>
                        inconvenience on their own part. So great is my gratitude for their
                        comradely good-fellowship that even nowten years after a final end came to
                        my newspaper workone of the first parts of the establishment I visit when I
                        have occasion to go to the <hi rend="i">World</hi> office is the composing
                        room, where old friends greet me cordially on every hand. Greatvery greatare
                        the printers. They do their work under a stress of hurry, noise, and
                        confusion that would drive less well-made men frantic, and they do it
                        mightily well. To one who knows, as I do, what the conditions are, every
                        printed newspaper page is a miracle of human achievement under well-nigh
                        inconceivable difficulties.</p>
                    <p>It was soon after my service on the <hi rend="i">World</hi> began that I
                        became acquainted with a man of brilliant gifts, often erratically employed,
                        and of singularly interesting personalityDon Piatt. From that time until his
                        death I saw much of him in a quiet club-corner way, and listened with
                        interest while he set forth his views and conclusions, always with a
                        suggestion of humor in them and often in perverse, paradoxical ways.</p>
                    <p>One day some question arose between us as to the failure of a certain book to
                        achieve the success we both thought it deserved. Don Piatt's explanation was
                        ready:</p>
                    <p>"It is because we have altogether too much education in this country," he
                        said. " You see, our schools are turning out about a million graduates every
                        year, under the mistaken belief that they are educated. All these boys and
                        girls have been taught how to read, but they haven't the smallest notion of
                        what to read, or why to read. They regard reading as you and I might regard
                        a game of solitaireas a convenient means of relaxing the mind, diverting the
                        attention from more serious thingsin brief, they read for amusement only,
                        and have no notion of any other possible purpose in reading. That's why
                        every sublimated idiot who makes a mountebank of himself as <pb
                            id="VAA2427-325" n="316"/> a 'humorist' wins his public instantly and
                        easily. The great majority of readers are that way minded, and of course the
                        publishers must cater to the taste of the multitude. They'd be worse idiots
                        than their customers if they didn't. It's the same way with plays. The
                        people who go to the theater want to be amused without the necessity of
                        doing even a little thinking. Why, a few years ago when Wallack was running
                        such things as ' She Stoops to Conquer,' 'School for Scandal,' 'London
                        Assurance,' and the like, in his old Thirteenth Street theater, with Dion
                        Boucicault, John Brougham, Harry Montague, John Gilbert, Harry Beckett, and
                        a lot of other really great actors in the casts, he played to slender
                        houses, while just around the corner there wasn't standing room when 'Pink
                        Dominoes' was on."</p>
                    <p>My acquaintance with Donn Piatt began in a rather curious way. Some time
                        before, there had appeared in one of the magazines a series of letters
                        signed " Arthur Richmond." They were political philippics, inspired chiefly
                        by a reckless, undiscriminating spirit of attack. They were as mysterious in
                        their origin as the letters of Junius, but otherwise they bore little if any
                        of the assumed and intended resemblance to that celebrated series. There was
                        little of judgment, discretion, or discrimination in them, and still less of
                        conscience. But they attracted widespread attention and the secret of their
                        authorship was a matter of a good deal of popular curiosity. A number of
                        very distinguished men were mentioned as conjectural possibilities in that
                        connection.</p>
                    <p>Even after the letters themselves had ceased to be of consequence, a certain
                        measure of curiosity as to their authorship survived, so that any newspaper
                        revelation of the secret was exceedingly desirable. One day somebody told me
                        that Donn Piatt had written them. Personally I did not know him, but in the
                        freemasonry of literature <pb id="VAA2427-326" n="317"/> and journalism
                        every man in the profession knows every other man in it well enough at least
                        for purposes of correspondence. So I wrote a half playful letter to Donn
                        Piatt, saying that somebody had charged him with the authorship of that
                        "iniquitous trash "for so I called itand asking him if I might affirm or
                        deny the statement in the <hi rend="i">World</hi>. He replied in a
                        characteristic letter, in which he said:</p>
                    <p>"I was one of a syndicate of blackguards engaged to write the 'Arthur
                        Richmond' letters and I did write some of them. You and I ought to know each
                        other personally and we don't. Why won't you come up to theClub to-night and
                        help me get rid of one of the infamous table d-hote dinners they sell there
                        for seventy-five cents? Then I'll tell you all about the 'Arthur Richmond'
                        letters and about any other crimes of my commission that may interest you.
                        Meanwhile, I'm sending you a letter for publication in answer to your
                        inquiry about that particular atrocity."</p>
                    <p>As we talked that night and on succeeding occasions, Donn Piatt told me many
                        interesting anecdotes of his career as a newspaper correspondent much given
                        to getting into difficulty with men in high place by reason of his freedom
                        in criticism and his vitriolic way of saying what he had to say in the most
                        effective words he could find.</p>
                    <p>"You see the dictionary was my ruin," he said after relating one of his
                        anecdotes. " I studied it not wisely but too well in my youth, and it taught
                        me a lot of words that have always seemed to me peculiarly effective in the
                        expression of thought, but to which generals and statesmen and the other
                        small fry of what is called public life, seem to have a rooted objection. By
                        the way, did you ever hear that I once committed arson? "</p>
                    <p>I pleaded ignorance of that incident in his career, and added:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-327" n="318"/>
                    <p>"I shall be interested to hear of that crime if you're sure it is protected
                        by the statute of limitations. I shouldn't like to be a witness to a
                        confession that might send you to the penitentiary."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I don't know that that would be so bad," he interrupted. "I'm living
                        with my publisher now, you know, and a change might not prove undesirable.
                        However, the crime is outlawed by time now. And besides, I didn't myself set
                        fire to the building. I'm guilty only under the legal maxim ' Qui facit per
                        alium facit per se.' The way of it was this: When I was a young man trying
                        to get into a law practice out in Ohio, and eager to advertise myself by
                        appearing in court, a fellow was indicted for arson. He came to me,
                        explaining that he had no money with which to pay a lawyer, but that he
                        thought I might like to appear in a case so important, and that if I would
                        do the best I could for him, he stood ready to do anything for me that he
                        could, by way of recompense. I took the case, of course. It was a complex
                        one and it offered opportunities for browbeating and ' balling up '
                        witnessesa process that specially impresses the public with the sagacity of
                        a lawyer who does it successfully. Then, if by any chance I should succeed
                        in acquitting my client, my place at the bar would be assured as that of ' a
                        sharp young feller, who had beaten the prosecuting attorney himself.'</p>
                    <p>"But in telling my client I would take his case the demon of humor betrayed
                        me. Just across the street from my lodging was a negro church, and there was
                        a 'revival' going on at the time. They ' revived ' till two o'clock or later
                        every night with shoutings that interfered with my sleep. With playful
                        impulse I said to the accused man:</p>
                    <p>"'You seem to be an expert in the arts of arson. If you'll burn that negro
                        church I'll feel that you have paid me full price for my service in
                        defending you.'</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-328" n="319"/>
                    <p>"I defended him and, as the witnesses against him were all of shady
                        character, I succeeded in securing his acquittal. About four o'clock the
                        next morning a fire broke out under all four corners of that negro church,
                        and before the local fire department got a quart of water into action, it
                        was a heap of smouldering asheshymn-books and all. A week or so later I
                        received a letter from my ex-client. He wrote from St. Louis, ' on his way
                        west,' he said. He expressed the hope that I was ' satisfied with results,'
                        and begged me to believe that he was ' a man of honor who never failed to
                        repay an obligation or reward a service.'"</p>
                    <p>With Donn Piatt's permission I told that story several times. Presently I
                        read it in brief form in a newspaper where the hero of it was set down as
                        "Tom Platt." I suppose the reporter in that case confused the closely
                        similar sounds of " Donn Piatt" and " Tom Platt." At any rate, it seems
                        proper to say that the venerable ex-Senator from New York never practiced
                        law in Ohio and never even unintentionally induced the burning of a church.
                        The story was Donn Piatt's and the experience was his.</p>

                    <head>LXVI</head>
                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">FIRST</hi> made Mr. Pulitzer's personal acquaintance in
                        Paris, where he was living at that time. I had been at work on the <hi
                            rend="i">World</hi> for a comparatively brief while, when he asked me to
                        visit him therean invitation which he several times afterwards repeated,
                        each time with increased pleasure to me.</p>
                    <p>On the occasion of my first visit to him, he said to me one evening at
                        dinner:</p>
                    <p>"I have invited you here with the primary purpose that you shall have a good
                        time. But secondly, I want to see you as often as I can. We have luncheon at
                        one o'clock, <pb id="VAA2427-329" n="320"/> and dinner at seven-thirty. I
                        wish you'd take luncheon and dinner with me as often as you can,
                        consistently with my primary purpose that you shall have a good time. If
                        you've anything else on hand that interests you more, you are not to come to
                        luncheon or dinner, and I will understand. But if you haven't anything else
                        on hand, I sincerely wish you'd come."</p>
                    <p>In all my experienceeven in Virginia during the old, limitlessly hospitable
                        plantation daysI think I never knew a hospitality superior to thisone that
                        left the guest so free to come on the one hand and so entirely free to stay
                        away without question if he preferred that. I, who have celebrated
                        hospitality of the most gracious kind in romances of Virginia, where
                        hospitality bore its most gorgeous blossoms and its richest fruitage, bear
                        witness that I have known no such exemplar of that virtue in its perfect
                        manifestation as Joseph Pulitzer.</p>
                    <p>Years afterwards, at Bar Harbor, I had been working with him night and day
                        over editorial problems of consequence, and, as I sat looking on at a game
                        of chess in which he was engaged one evening, he suddenly ordered me to
                        bed.</p>
                    <p>"You've been overworking," he said. " You are to go to bed now, and you are
                        not to get up till you feel like getting upeven if it is two days hence. Go,
                        I tell you, and pay no heed to hours or anything else. You shall not be
                        interrupted in your sleep."</p>
                    <p>I was very weary and I went to bed. The next morningor I supposed it to be
                        soI waked, and looked at my watch. It told me it was six o'clock. I tried to
                        woo sleep again, but the effort was a failure. I knew that breakfast would
                        not be served for some hours to come, but I simply could not remain in bed
                        longer. I knew where a certain dear little lad of the family kept his
                        fishing tackle and his bait. I decided that I would get up, take <pb
                            id="VAA2427-330" n="321"/> a cold plunge, pilfer the tackle, and spend
                        an hour or two down on the rocks fishing.</p>
                    <p>With this intent I slipped out of my room, making no noise lest I should wake
                        some one from his morning slumber. The first person I met was Mr. Pulitzer.
                        He gleefully greeted me with congratulations upon the prolonged sleep I had
                        had, and after a brief confusion of mind, I found that it was two o'clock in
                        the afternoon, and that my unwound watch had misled me. In his anxiety that
                        I should have my sleep out, Mr. Pulitzer had shut off the entire half of the
                        building in which my bedroom lay, and had stationed a servant as sentinel to
                        prohibit intrusion upon that part of the premises and to forbid everything
                        in the nature of noise.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pulitzer himself never rested, in the days of my association with him.
                        His mind knew no surcease of its activity. He slept little, and with
                        difficulty. His waking hours, whether up or in bed, were given to a
                        ceaseless wrestling with the problems that belong to a great newspaper's
                        conduct. I have known him to make an earnest endeavor to dismiss these for a
                        time. To that end he would peremptorily forbid all reference to them in the
                        conversation of those about him. But within the space of a few minutes he
                        would be in the midst of them again, and completely absorbed. But he
                        recognized the necessity of rest for brains other than his own, and in all
                        kindly ways sought to secure and even to compel it. I remember once at Bar
                        Harbor, when for two or three days and nights in succession I had been at
                        work on something he greatly wanted done, he said to me at breakfast:</p>
                    <p>"You're tired, and that task is finished. I want you to rest, and, of course,
                        so long as you and I remain together you can't rest. Your brain is active
                        and so is mine. If we stay in each other's company we shall talk, and with
                        us talk means work. In five minutes we'll be <pb id="VAA2427-331" n="322"/>
                        planning some editorial crusade, and you'll get to work again. So I want you
                        to go away from me. Let Eugene drive you to the village, and there secure an
                        open carriage and a pair of good horsesthe best you can getand drive all
                        over this interesting island. Get yourself rested. And when you come back,
                        don't let me talk newspaper with you, till you've had a night's sleep."</p>
                    <p>It was in that kindly spirit that Mr. Pulitzer always treated his lieutenants
                        when he invited them to pass a time with him. So long as he and they were
                        together, he could not help working them almost to death. But, when he
                        realized their weariness, he sent them off to rest, on carriage drives or
                        yachting voyages or what not, with generous consideration of their inability
                        to carry weight as he did night and day and every day and every night.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes his eagerness in work led him to forget his own kindly purpose. I
                        remember once when I had been writing all day and throughout most of the
                        night in execution of his prolific inspiration, he suddenly became aware of
                        the fact that I must be weary. Instantly he said:</p>
                    <p>"You must rest. You must take a carriage or a boat and go off somewhere.
                        Think out where it shall be, for yourself. But you sha'n't do another thing
                        till you've had a good rest."</p>
                    <p>Then, as we strolled out into the porch and thence to the sea wall against
                        which the breakers were recklessly dashing themselves to pieces, he suddenly
                        thought of something. In a minute we were engaged in discussing that
                        something, and half an hour later I was busy in my room, with books of
                        reference all about me, working out that something, and it was three o'clock
                        next morning before I finished the writing of what he wanted written on that
                        theme. At breakfast next morning I was late, and the fact reminded him of
                        the plans he had formed twenty-four <pb id="VAA2427-332" n="323"/> hours
                        before for a rest for me. He refused even to light a cigar until I should be
                        gone.</p>
                    <p>"If we smoke together," he said, "we shall talk. If we talk we shall become
                        interested and you'll be set to work again. Get you hence. Let me see no
                        more of you till dinner to-night. In the meantime, do what you will to rest
                        yourself. That's my only concern now. Drive, sail, row, loaf, play
                        billiardsdo whatever will best rest you."</p>
                    <p>I relate these things by way of showing forth one side of the character of a
                        man who has wrought a revolution in the world. I have other things to relate
                        that show forth another side of that interestingly complex nature.</p>
                    <p>In his anxiety to secure terseness of editorial utterance he at one time
                        limited all editorials to fifty lines each. As I had final charge of the
                        editorial page on four nights of the week, I found myself obliged, by the
                        rule, to spoil many compact articles written by other men, by cutting out a
                        line or two from things already compacted "to the limit."</p>
                    <p>I said this to Mr. Pulitzer one day, and he replied:</p>
                    <p>"Well, just to show you that I have no regard for cast-iron rules, I am going
                        to ask you now to write four columns on a subject of public importance."</p>
                    <p>The subject was the nomination of Judge Maynard for Justice of the Court of
                        Appeals. Judge Maynard stood accused oflet us say questionableconduct in
                        judicial office in relation to certain election proceedings. The details
                        have no place here. Judge Maynard had never been impeached, and his friends
                        indignantly repudiated every suggestion that his judicial conduct had been
                        in any wise influenced by partisan considerations. His enemiesand they were
                        many, including men of high repute in his own partycontended that his
                        judicial course in that <pb id="VAA2427-333" n="324"/> election matter
                        unfitted him for election to the higher office.</p>
                    <p>I have every reason to believeevery reason that eleven years of editorial
                        association can givethat in every case involving the public welfare, or
                        public morality, or official fitness, Mr. Pulitzer sincerely desires to
                        ascertain the facts and to govern his editorial course accordingly. I have
                        never been able to regard him as a Democrat or a Republican in politics. He
                        has impressed me always as an opportunist, caring far more for practical
                        results than for doctrinaire dogmas.</p>
                    <p>In this Maynard case the contentions were conflicting, the assertions
                        contradictory, and the facts uncertain so far at least as the <hi rend="i"
                            >World</hi> knew them.</p>
                    <p>"I want you to go into the Maynard case," said Mr. Pulitzer to me," with an
                        absolutely unprejudiced mind. We hold no brief for or against him, as you
                        know. I want you to get together all the documents in the case. I want you
                        to take them home and study them as minutely as if you were preparing
                        yourself for an examination. I want you to regard yourself as a judicial
                        officer, oath-bound to justice, and when you shall have mastered the facts
                        and the law in the case, I want you to set them forth in a four-column
                        editorial that every reader of the <hi rend="i">World</hi> can easily
                        understand."</p>
                    <p>This was only one of many cases in which he set me or some other lieutenant
                        to find out facts and determine what justice demanded, in order that justice
                        might be done.</p>
                    <p>In 1896, when the Democratic party made its surrender to populism and
                        wild-eyed socialism by nominating Bryan, I was at the convention in Chicago,
                        telegraphing editorial articles. I foreshadowed the nomination as
                        inevitable, contrary to the predictions of the <hi rend="i">World's</hi>
                        newsgatherers in the convention. Instantly, and before the nomination was
                        made, Mr. Pulitzer telegraphed me from Bar Harbor, to <pb id="VAA2427-334"
                            n="325"/> come to him at once. By the time I got there the nomination
                        was a fact accomplished.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pulitzer said to me:</p>
                    <p>"I'm not going to tell you what my own views of the situation are, or what I
                        think ought to be the course of the <hi rend="i">World</hi>, as a foremost
                        Democratic newspaper, under the circumstances. No "seeing that I was about
                        to speak" don't say a word about your own views. They are necessarily hasty
                        and ill-considered as yet, just as my own are. I want you to take a full
                        twenty-four hours for careful thought. At the end of that time I want you to
                        write out your views of the policy the <hi rend="i">World</hi> ought to
                        adopt, giving your reasons for every conclusion reached."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pulitzer did not adopt precisely the policy I recommended on that
                        occasion. But the <hi rend="i">World</hi> refused to support the Bryan
                        candidacy with its fundamental idea of debasing the currency by the free
                        coinage of silver dollars intrinsically worth only fifty cents apiece or
                        less.</p>
                    <p>While I was still his guest on that mission, there came to Bar Harbor an
                        emissary from Mr. Bryan, who asked for an interview with Mr. Pulitzer in Mr.
                        Bryan's behalf. As I happened to know the young man, Mr. Pulitzer asked me
                        to see him in his stead and to receive his message. Armed with full
                        credentials as Mr. Pulitzer's accredited representative, I visited the young
                        ambassador, and made careful notes of the message he had to deliver. It was
                        to this effect:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bryan was unselfishly anxious to save the reputation of the newspaper
                        press as a power in public affairs. His election by an overwhelming
                        majority, he said, was certain beyond all possibility of doubt or question.
                        But if it should be accomplished without the support of the <hi rend="i"
                            >World</hi> or any other of the supposedly influential Democratic
                        newspapers, there must be an end to the tradition <pb id="VAA2427-335"
                            n="326"/> of press power and newspaper influence in politics. For the
                        sake of the press, and especially of so great a newspaper as the <hi
                            rend="i">World</hi>, therefore, Mr. Bryan asked Mr. Pulitzer's attention
                        to this danger to prestige.</p>
                    <p>When I delivered this message to Mr. Pulitzer, he laughed. Then he gave me a
                        truly remarkable exhibition of his masterful knowledge of American political
                        conditions, and of his sagacious prescience. He asked me to jot down some
                        figures as he should give them to me. He named the states that would vote
                        for Bryan with the number of electoral votes belonging to each. Then he gave
                        me the list of states that would go against Bryan, with their electoral
                        strength. When I had put it all down, he said:</p>
                    <p>"I don't often predictnever unless I know. But you may embody that table in
                        an editorial, predicting that the result of the election four months hence
                        will be very nearly, if not exactly, what those lists foreshadow. Let that
                        be our answer to Mr. Bryan's audacious message."</p>
                    <p>The campaign had not yet opened. Mr. Bryan had just been nominated with
                        positively wild enthusiasm. The movement which afterwards put Palmer in the
                        field as an opposing Democratic candidate had not yet been thought of. All
                        conditions suggested uncertainty, and yet, as we sat there in his little
                        private porch at Bar Harbor, Mr. Pulitzer correctly named every state that
                        would give its electoral vote to each candidate, and the returns of the
                        electionfour months latervaried from his prediction of results by only two
                        electoral votes out of four hundred and forty-seven. And that infinitesimal
                        variation resulted solely from the fact that by some confusion of ballots in
                        California and Kentucky each of those states gave one vote to Bryan and the
                        rest to his opponent.</p>
                    <p>I have known nothing in the way of exact political pre-science, <pb
                            id="VAA2427-336" n="327"/> long in advance of the event, that equaled
                        this or approached it. I record it as phenomenal.</p>

                    <p>E<hi rend="sc">VER</hi> since the time when he bought two St. Louis
                        newspapers, both of which were losing money, combined them, and made of them
                        one of the most profitable newspaper properties in the country, Mr.
                        Pulitzer's methods have been Napoleonic both in the brilliancy of their
                        conception and in the daring of their execution. I may here record as a
                        personal recollection the story of one of his newspaper achievements. The
                        fact of it is well enough known; the details of its dramatic execution have
                        never been told, I think.</p>
                    <p>In February, 1895, the government of the United States found it necessary to
                        issue $62,300,000 in four per cent., thirty-year bonds, to make good the
                        depletion of the gold reserve in the treasury. The bonds were sold to a
                        syndicate at the rate of 104 3/4. Once on the market, they quickly advanced
                        in price until they were sold by the end of that year at 118, and, if any
                        bank or investor wanted them in considerable quantities, the price paid was
                        122 or more.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of the next year it was announced that the treasury would
                        sell $200,000,000 more of precisely the same bonds, printed from the same
                        plates, payable at the same time, and in all respects undistinguishable from
                        those of the year beforeat that time in eager popular demand at 118 to 122.
                        It was also announced that the treasury had arranged to sell these
                        bondsworth 118 or more in the open marketto the same old Morgan syndicate
                        "at about the same price" (104 3/4), at which the preceding issue had been
                        sold.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2427-337" n="328"/>
                    <p>Mr. Pulitzer justly regarded this as a scandalous proposal to give the
                        syndicate more than twenty-six millions of dollars of the people's money in
                        return for no service whatever. The banks and the people of the country
                        wanted these bonds at 118 or more, and banks and bankers in other countries
                        were equally eager to get them at the same rate. It seemed to him, as it
                        seemed to every other well-informed person, that this was a reckless waste
                        of the people's money, the scandalous favoring of a syndicate of
                        speculators, and a damaging blow to the national credit. But, unlike most
                        other well-informed persons, Mr. Pulitzer refused to regard the situation as
                        one beyond saving, although it was given out from Washington that the
                        bargain with the syndicate was already irrevocably made.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pulitzer set his editorial writers at work to make the facts of the case
                        clear to every intelligent mind; to show forth the needlessness of the
                        proposed squandering; to emphasize the scandal of this dealing in the dark
                        with a gang of Wall Street bettors upon a certainty; and to demonstrate the
                        people's readiness and even eagerness to subscribe for the bonds at a much
                        higher rate than the discrediting one at which the Treasury had secretly
                        agreed to sell them to the syndicate.</p>
                    <p>When all this had been done, to no purpose so far as I could see, inasmuch as
                        the response from Washington was insistent to the effect that the sale was
                        already agreed upon, Mr. Pulitzer one afternoon summoned me to go at once to
                        Lakewood, where he was staying at the time. The train by which alone I could
                        go was to arrive at Lakewood after the departure of the last train thence
                        for New York that evening, and I mentioned that fact over the telephone. For
                        reply I was asked to come anyhow.</p>
                    <p>When I got there night had already fallen, and as I <pb id="VAA2427-338"
                            n="329"/> was without even so much as a handbag, I anticipated a night
                        of makeshift at the hotel. But as I entered Mr. Pulitzer's quarters he
                        greeted me and said:</p>
                    <p>"Come in quickly. We must talk rapidly and to the point. You think you're to
                        stay here all night, but you're mistaken. As this is your night to be in
                        charge of the editorial page, you must be in the office of the <hi rend="i"
                            >World</hi> at ten o'clock. I've ordered a special train to take you
                        back. It will start at eight o'clock and run through in eighty minutes.
                        Meanwhile, we have much to arrange, so we must get to work."</p>
                    <p>E. O. Chamberlin, the managing editor of the news department of the <hi
                            rend="i">World</hi>, was there and had already received his
                        instructions. To me Mr. Pulitzer said:</p>
                    <p>"We have made our case in this matter of the bond issue. We have presented
                        the facts clearly, convincingly, conclusively, but the Administration
                        refuses to heed them. We are now going to compel it to heed them on pain of
                        facing a scandal that no administration could survive.</p>
                    <p>"What we demand is that these bonds shall be sold to the public at something
                        like their actual value and not to a Wall Street syndicate for many millions
                        less. You understand all that. You are to write a double-leaded article to
                        occupy the whole editorial space to-morrow morning. You are not to print a
                        line of editorial on any other subject. You are to set forth, in compact
                        form and in the most effective way possible, the facts of the case and the
                        considerations that demand a popular or at least a public loan instead of
                        this deal with a syndicate, suggestive as it is of the patent falsehood that
                        the United States Treasury's credit needs 'financing.' You are to declare,
                        with all possible emphasis that the banks, bankers, and people of the United
                        States stand ready and eager to lend their government all the money it wants
                        at three <pb id="VAA2427-339" n="330"/> per cent, interest, and to buy its
                        four per cent, bonds at a premium that will amount to that."</p>
                    <p>He went on in this way, outlining the article he wanted me to write.</p>
                    <p>"Then, as a guarantee of the sincerity of our conviction you are to say that
                        the <hi rend="i">World</hi> offers in advance to take one million dollars of
                        the new bonds at the highest market price, if they are offered to the public
                        in open market.</p>
                    <p>"In the meanwhile, Chamberlin has a staff of men sending out despatches to
                        every bank and banker in the land, setting forth our demand for a public
                        loan instead of a syndicate dicker, and asking each for what amount of the
                        new bonds it or he will subscribe on a three per cent, basis. To-morrow
                        morning's paper will carry with your editorial its complete confirmation in
                        their replies, and the proposed loan will be oversubscribed on a three per
                        cent, basis. Even Mr. Cleveland's phenomenal self-confidence and Mr.
                        Carlisle's purblind belief in Wall Street methods will not be able to
                        withstand such a demonstration as that. It will <hi rend="i">compel a public
                            loan</hi>. If it is true that the contract with the syndicate has
                        already been made, <hi rend="i">they must cancel it</hi>. The voice of the
                        country will be heard in the subscription list we shall print to-morrow
                        morning, and the voice of the country has compelling power, even under this
                        excessively self-confident administration. Now, you're faint with hunger.
                        Hurry over to the hotel and get a bite to eat. You have thirty minutes
                        before your special train leaves."</p>
                    <p>I hurried to the hotel, but I spent that thirty minutes, not in eating but in
                        making a written report, for my own future use, of Mr. Pulitzer's
                        instructions. The memorandum thus made is the basis of what I have written
                        above.</p>
                    <p>The climax of the great national drama thus put upon <pb id="VAA2427-340"
                            n="331"/> the stage was worthy of the genius that inspired it. The
                        responses of the banks and bankerssent in during the nightshowed a
                        tremendous oversubscription of the proposed loan at a price that would yield
                        to the government many millions more than the syndicate sale offered, and
                        there remained unheard from the thousands and tens of thousands of private
                        persons who were eager to buy the bonds as investment securities. In the
                        face of the facts thus demonstrated, it would have been political suicide
                        for the men in control at Washington to refuse a public loan and to sell the
                        bonds to the syndicate for millions less than the people were eager to pay
                        for them. The administration yielded to moral force, but it did so
                        grudgingly and with manifest reluctance. It cut down the proposed loan to
                        the minimum that the Treasury must have, and it hedged it about with every
                        annoying device that might embarrass willing investors and prevent the
                        subscriptions of others than banks and bankers. In spite of all such efforts
                        to minimize the administration's defeat, the bond issue was promptly taken
                        up at a price that saved many millions to the Treasury, and within a brief
                        while the very bonds that Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Carlisle had so insistently
                        desired to sell to the syndicate at 104 3/4 were very hard to get in the
                        open market at 133 or more.</p>
                    <p>I have related this incident with some fullness because I know of no other
                        case in which the "power of the press"which being interpreted means the
                        power of public opinionto control reluctant political and governmental
                        forces, has been so dramatically illustrated.</p>
                    <p>The only other case comparable with it was that in which not one newspaper
                        but practically all the newspapers in the land with a united voice saved the
                        country from chaos and civil war by compelling a wholly unwilling and very
                        obstinate Congress to find a way out of <pb id="VAA2427-341" n="332"/> the
                        electoral controversy between Tilden and Hayes. No newspaper man who was in
                        Washington at any time during that controversy doubts or can doubt that the
                        two Houses of Congress would have adhered obstinately to their opposing
                        views until the end, with civil war as a necessary consequence, but for the
                        ceaseless insistence of all the newspapers of both parties that they should
                        devise and agree upon some peaceful plan by which the controversy might be
                        adjusted.</p>
                    <p>At the time when the prospect seemed darkest I asked Carl Schurz for his
                        opinion of the outcome. He replied, with that intense earnestness in his
                        voice and words which his patriotism always gave to them in times of public
                        danger:</p>
                    <p>"If left to the two Houses of Congress to decideand that is where the
                        Constitution leaves itthe question will not be decided; on the contrary, the
                        more they discuss it, the more intense and unyielding their obstinate
                        determination not to agree will become. If it isn't settled before the
                        fourth of March, God only knows what the result will becivil war and chaos
                        are the only things to be foreseen. But if left alone, as I say, the two
                        Houses of Congress will to the end refuse to agree upon any plan of
                        adjustment. The outlook is very gloomy, very discouraging, very black. Only
                        a tremendous pressure of public opinion can save us from results more
                        calamitous than any that the human mind can conceive. If the newspapers can
                        be induced to see the danger and realize its extentif they can persuade
                        themselves to put aside their partisanship and unite in an insistent demand
                        that Congress shall find a way out, a peaceful result may be compelled.
                        Fortunately, the Southern men in both houses are eager for the
                        accomplishment of that. They and their constituents have had enough and to
                        spare of civil war. They may be easily won to the support of any plan that
                            <pb id="VAA2427-342" n="333"/> promises to bring about a peaceful
                        solution of the controversy. But public opinion, as reflected in the
                        newspapers, must compel Congress, or nothing will be done."</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>LXVIII</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> mention of Mr. Schurz reminds me of some other
                        occasions on which I had intercourse with him. He and I many times served
                        together on committees that had to do with matters of public interest. We
                        were members of the same clubs, and we saw much of each other at private
                        dinners and in other social ways, so that I came to know him well and to
                        appreciate at its full value that absolute honesty of mind which I regard as
                        his distinguishing characteristic. Without that quality of sincerity, and
                        with a conscience less exigent and less resolute than his, Carl Schurz's
                        political career might have compassed any end that ambition set before him.
                        That is perhaps a reflection on public life and the men engaged in it. If
                        so, I cannot help it. As it was, he never hesitated for a moment to "quarrel
                        with his bread and butter" if his antagonism to wrong, and especially to
                        everything that militated against human liberty, called for such quarreling.
                        He was above all things a patriot in whose estimation considerations of the
                        public welfare outweighed, overrode, and trampled to earth all other
                        considerations of what kind soever. Party was to him no more than an
                        implement, a tool for the accomplishment of patriotic ends, and he gave to
                        party no allegiance whatever beyond the point at which it ceased to serve
                        such ends. He was always ready to quarrel with his own party and quit it for
                        cause, even when it offered him high preferment as the reward of continued
                        allegiance.</p>
                    <p>In the same way, he held the scales true in all his judgments <pb
                            id="VAA2427-343" n="334"/> of men. Mr. Lincoln once wrote him a
                        letteroften quoted by his enemieswhich any "statesman" of the accepted type
                        would have regarded as an unforgivable affront. Yet in due time Mr. Schurz
                        wrote an appreciative estimate of Lincoln which has no fit fellow in the
                        whole body of Lincoln literature. His judgments of men and measures were
                        always the honest conclusions of an honest mind that held in reverence no
                        other creed than that of truth and preached no other gospel than that of
                        human liberty.</p>
                    <p>One evening I sat with him at a little dinner given by Mr. James Ford Rhodes,
                        the historian. Paul Leicester Ford sat between him and me, while on my right
                        sat our hostess and some other gentlewomen. Our hostess presently asked me
                        what I thought of a certain distinguished personage whose name was at that
                        time in everybody's mouth, and whose popularitychiefly won by genial,
                        humorous, after-dinner speakingwas wholly unmatched throughout the country.
                        I do not mention his name, because he still lives and is under a cloud.</p>
                    <p>I answered that I thought him one of the worst and most dangerous of popular
                        public men, adding:</p>
                    <p>"He has done more than any other man living to corrupt legislatures and
                        pervert legislation to the service of iniquitous corporations."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schurz, who was talking to some one at the other end of the table, caught
                        some hint of what I had said. He instantly turned upon me with a demand that
                        I should repeat it. I supposed that a controversy was coming, and by way of
                        challenging the worst, I repeated what I had said, with added emphasis. Mr.
                        Schurz replied:</p>
                    <p>"You are right so far as your criticism goes. The man has done all that you
                        charge in the way of corrupting legislatures and perverting legislation. He
                        has made <pb id="VAA2427-344" n="335"/> a business of it. But that is the
                        very smallest part of his offense against morality, good government, and
                        free institutions. His far greater sin is that he has <hi rend="i">made
                            corruption respectable</hi>, in the eyes of the people. And those who
                        invite him to banquets and set him to speak there, and noisily applaud him,
                        are all of them partners in his criminality whether they know it or
                        not."</p>
                    <p>One other conversation with Mr. Schurz strongly impressed me with his exalted
                        character and the memory of it lingers in my mind. In the summer of the year
                        1900, when Mr. Bryan was nominated for the second time for President, on a
                        platform strongly reaffirming his free silver policy and everything else for
                        which he had stood in 1896, it was given out that Carl Schurz, who had
                        bitterly and effectively opposed him in 1896, intended now to support him. I
                        had finally withdrawn from the <hi rend="i">World's</hi> service, and from
                        newspaper work of every kind, and was passing the summer in literary work at
                        my cottage on Lake George. But the <hi rend="i">World</hi> telegraphed me
                        asking me to see Mr. Schurz, who was also a Lake George cottager, and get
                        from him some statement of his reasons for now supporting the man and the
                        policies that he had so strenuously opposed four years before.</p>
                    <p>I had no idea that Mr. Schurz would give me any such statement for
                        publication, but he and I had long been friends, and a call upon him would
                        occupy a morning agreeably, with the remote chance that I might incidentally
                        render a service to my friends of the <hi rend="i">World</hi> staff.
                        Therefore, I went.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schurz told me frankly that he could give me nothing for publication,
                        just as I had expected that he would do.</p>
                    <p>"I am going to make one or two speeches in this campaign," he said, "and
                        anything I might give you now would simply take the marrow out of my
                        speeches. But <pb id="VAA2427-345" n="336"/> personally I shall be glad to
                        talk the matter over with you. It seems to me to be one of positively vital
                        importancenot to parties, for now that I have come to the end of an active
                        life I care nothing for partiesbut to our country and to the cause of human
                        liberty."</p>
                    <p>"You think human liberty is involved?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, certainly. Those conceptions upon which human liberty rests in every
                        country in the world had their birth in the colonies out of which this
                        nation was formed and they were first effectively formulated in the
                        Declaration of Independence and enacted into fundamental law in our
                        Constitution. The spectacle of a great, free, rich, and powerful nation
                        securely built upon those ideas as its foundation has been an inspiration to
                        all other peoples, and better still, a compulsion upon all rulers. If that
                        inspiration is lost, and that compulsion withdrawn, the brutal military
                        force that buttresses thrones will quickly undo all that our influence has
                        accomplished in teaching men their rights and warning monarchs of their
                        limitations."</p>
                    <p>In answer to further questions he went on to say:</p>
                    <p>"The spirit of imperialismwhich is the arch-enemy of human libertyis rampant
                        in the land, and it seems to me the supreme duty of every man who loves
                        liberty to oppose it with all his might, at whatever sacrifice of lesser
                        things he may find to be necessary. I am as antagonistic to Mr. Bryan's free
                        silver policy and to some other policies of his as I was four years ago. But
                        the time has come when men on the other side jeer at the Declaration of
                        Independence and mock at the Constitution itself. There is danger in thisa
                        danger immeasurably greater than any that financial folly threatens. It
                        seems to me time for a revolutionnot a revolution of violence or one which
                        seeks overthrow, but a revolution of public opinion designed to restore the
                        landmarks and <pb id="VAA2427-346" n="337"/> bring the country back to its
                        foundations of principle. Financial folly, such as Mr. Bryan advocates,
                        threatens us with nothing worse than a temporary disturbance of business
                        affairs. Imperialism threatens us with the final destruction of those ideas
                        and principles that have made our country great in itself and immeasurably
                        greater in its influence upon thought and upon the welfare of humanity in
                        every country on earth."</p>
                    <p>I have recorded Mr. Schurz's words here, as nearly as a trained memory allows
                        me to do, not with the smallest concern for the political issues of nine
                        years ago, but solely because his utterances on that occasion seem to me to
                        have shown forth, as nothing else could have done, the high inspiration of
                        his patriotism, and to explain what many have regarded as the
                        inconsistencies of his political attitude at various periods of his life.
                        That so-called inconsistency was in fact a higher consistency. His
                        allegiance was at all times given to principles, to ideas, to high
                        considerations of right and of human liberty, and in behalf of these he
                        never hesitated to sacrifice his political prospects, his personal
                        advantage, or anything else that he held to be of less human
                        consequence.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the spring of the year 1900 I finally ceased to be a
                        newspaper worker. I was weary, almost beyond expression, of the endless
                        grind of editorial endeavor. My little summer home in the woodlands on Lake
                        George lured me to the quiet, independent, literary life that I had always
                        desired. There was an accumulation in my mind of things I longingly desired
                        to do, and the opportunity to do them came. Above all, I wanted to be free
                        once moreto be nobody's "hired man," to be subject <pb id="VAA2427-347"
                            n="338"/> to no man's control, however generous and kindly that control
                        might be.</p>
                    <p>Life conditions at my place, "Culross," were ideal, with no exacting social
                        obligations, with plenty of fishing, rowing, and sailing, with my giant
                        pines, hemlocks, oaks, and other trees for companions, and with the sweetest
                        air to breathe that human lungs could desire.</p>
                    <p>I had just published a boys' book that passed at once into second and
                        successive editions. The publishers of it had asked me for more books of
                        that kind, and still more insistently for novels, while with other
                        publishers the way was open to me for some historical and biographical
                        writings and for works of other kinds, that I had long planned.</p>
                    <p>Under these favorable circumstances I joyously established anew the literary
                        workshop which had twice before been broken up by that "call of the wild,"
                        the lure of journalism.</p>
                    <p>This time, the summer-time shop consisted, and still consists, of a cozy
                        corner in one of the porches of my rambling, rock-perched cottage. There,
                        sheltered from the rain when it came and from the fiercer of the winds, I
                        spread a broad rug on the floor and placed my writing table and chair upon
                        it, and there for ten years I have done my work in my own way, at my own
                        times, and in all other ways as it has pleased me to do it. In that corner,
                        I have only to turn my head in order to view the most beautiful of all lakes
                        lying almost at my feet and only thirty or forty feet away. If I am seized
                        with the impulse to go fishing, my fishing boat with its well-stocked bait
                        wells is there inviting me. If I am minded to go upon the water for rest and
                        thoughtor to be rid of thought for a timethere are other boats in my dock,
                        boats of several sorts and sizes, among which I am free to choose. If the
                        weather is inclement, there are open <pb id="VAA2427-348" n="339"/>
                        fireplaces within the house and an ample stock of wood at hand.</p>
                    <p>For ten years past I have spent all my summers in these surroundingsstaying
                        at "Culross" four or five or even six months in each year and returning to
                        town only for the period of winter stress.</p>
                    <p>During the ten years in which that corner of the porch has been my chief
                        workshop, I have added twenty-odd books to the dozen or so published before,
                        besides doing other literary work amounting to about an equal product, and
                        if I live, the end is not yet. I make this statistical statement as an
                        illustration of the stimulating effect of freedom upon the creative faculty.
                        The man who must do anything elseif it be only to carry a cane, or wear
                        cuffs, or crease his trousers, or do any other thing that involves attention
                        and distracts the mind, is seriously handicapped for creative work of any
                        kind.</p>
                    <p>I have worked hard, of course. He who would make a living with his pen must
                        do that of necessity. But the work has been always a joy to me, and such
                        weariness as it brings is only that which gives added pleasure to the rest
                        that follows.</p>

                    <p>E<hi rend="sc">VERY</hi> literary worker has his own methods, and I have
                        never known any one of them to adopt the methods of another with success.
                        Temperament has a good deal to do with it; habit, perhaps, a good deal more,
                        and circumstance more than all.</p>
                    <p>I have always been an extemporaneous writer, if I may apply the adjective to
                        writers as we do to speakers. I have never been able to sit down and "
                        compose" anything before writing it. I have endeavored always to master the
                        subjects of my writing by study and careful <pb id="VAA2427-349" n="340"/>
                        thought, but I have never known when I wrote a first sentence or a first
                        chapter what the second was to be. I think from the point of my pen, so far
                        at least as my thinking formulates itself in written words.</p>
                    <p>I suppose this to be a consequence of my thirty-odd years of newspaper
                        experience. In the giddy, midnight whirl of making a great newspaper there
                        is no time for "first drafts," "outline sketches," "final revisions," and
                        all that sort of thing. When the telegraph brings news at midnight that
                        requires a leaderperhaps in double leadsthe editorial writer has an hour or
                        less, with frequent interruptions, in which to write his article, get it
                        into type, revise the proofs, and make up the page that contains it. He has
                        no choice but to write extemporancously. He must hurriedly set down on paper
                        what his newspaper has to say on the subject, and send his sheets at once to
                        the printers, sometimes keeping messenger boys at his elbow to take the
                        pages from his hand one after another as fast as they are written. His only
                        opportunity for revision is on the proof slips, and even in that he is
                        limited by the necessity of avoiding every alteration that may involve the
                        overrunning of a line.</p>
                    <p>In this and other ways born of necessity, the newspaper writer learns the art
                        of extemporaneous writing, which is only another way of saying that he
                        learns how to write at his best in the first instance, without lazily
                        depending upon revision for smoothness, clearness, terseness, and force. He
                        does not set down ill-informed or ill-considered judgments. Every hour of
                        every day of his life is given to the close study of the subjects upon which
                        he is at last called upon to write under stress of tremendous hurry. He
                        knows all about his theme. He has all the facts at his fingers' ends. He is
                        familiar with every argument that has been or can be made on the questions
                        involved. He knows all his statistics, and his judgments <pb
                            id="VAA2427-350" n="341"/> have been carefully thought out in advance.
                        His art consists in the ability to select on the instant what phases of the
                        subject he will treat, and to write down his thought clearly, impressively,
                        convincingly, and in the best rhetorical form he can give it.</p>
                    <p>I think that one who has acquired that habit of extemporaneous writing about
                        things already mastered in thought can never learn to write in any other
                        way. Both experience and observation have convinced me that men of that
                        intellectual habit do more harm than good to their work when they try to
                        improve it by revision. Revision in every such case is apt to mean
                        elaboration, and elaboration is nearly always a weakening dilution of
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>I am disposed to think that whatever saves trouble to the writer is purchased
                        at the expense of the reader. The classic dictum that "easy writing makes
                        hard reading" is as true to-day as it was when Horace made laborious use of
                        the flat end of his stylus. For myself, at any rate, I have never been able
                        to "dictate," either "to the machine," or to a stenographer, with
                        satisfactory results, nor have I ever known anybody else to do so without
                        some sacrifice to laziness of that which it is worth a writer's while to
                        toil for. The stenographer and the typewriter have their place as servants
                        of commerce, but in literature they tend to diffusion, prolixity,
                        inexactitude, and, above all, to carelessness in that choice of words that
                        makes the difference between grace and clumsiness, lucidity and cloud, force
                        and feebleness.</p>
                    <p>In the writing of novels, I have always been seriously embarrassed by the
                        strange perversity of fictitious people. That is a matter that has puzzled
                        and deeply interested me ever since I became a practising novelist.</p>
                    <p>The most ungrateful people in the world are the brainchildren of the
                        novelist, the male and female folk whose existence is due to the good will
                        of the writer. Born of <pb id="VAA2427-351" n="342"/> the travail of the
                        novelist's brain, and endowed by him with whatever measure of wit, wisdom,
                        or wealth they possess; personally conducted by him in their struggles
                        toward the final happiness he has foreordained for them at the end of the
                        story; cared for; coddled; listened to and reported even when they talk
                        nonsense, and not infrequently when they only think it; laboriously brought
                        to the attention of other people; pushed, if possible, into a fame they
                        could never have achieved for themselves; they nevertheless obstinately
                        persist in thwarting their creator's purpose and doing as they wickedly
                        please to his sore annoyance and vexation of spirit.</p>
                    <p>In truth, the author of a story has very little control over its course after
                        he has once laid its foundations. The novel is not madeit grows, and the
                        novelist does little more than plant the seed and keep the growth unchoked
                        by weeds. He is as powerless to make it other than what it tends to be as
                        the gardener is to grow tomatoes on cornstalks or cucumbers on pea-vines. He
                        may create for the story what manner of people he pleases, just as the
                        gardener may choose the seed he will plant; but once created these
                        fictitious people will behave according to their individual natures without
                        heed to the wishes of the author of their being.</p>
                    <p>In other words, the novelist is under bond to his conscience to represent his
                        personages as talking and acting precisely as such personages would talk and
                        act under the circumstances in which he has placed them. It often happens
                        that their sentiments, their utterances, and their conduct do not fit into
                        the author's preconceived arrangement of happenings, so that he must alter
                        his entire story or important parts of it to make it true.</p>
                    <p>I have borrowed the last few paragraphs from a playful paper I wrote for an
                        obscure magazine thirty-odd years ago, because they suggest a trouble that
                        must come to <pb id="VAA2427-352" n="343"/> every conscientious novelist
                        many times during the writing of every story. There come times when the
                        novelist doesn't know what happened, and must toilsomely explore his
                        consciousness by way of finding out.</p>
                    <p>My working hours are determined by circumstancesmorning, afternoon, evening,
                        or late at night. When there is a "must" involved, I work when I must; when
                        I am free I work when I choose or when I feel that I can.</p>
                    <p>I never carry my work to bed with me, and I never let it rob me of a moment's
                        sleep. To avoid that I usually play a game or two of solitaireperhaps the
                        least intellectual of all possible occupationsbetween work and bedtime; and
                        I usually take a walk in the open air just before going to bed, whatever the
                        weather may be. But whatever else happens, I long ago acquired the art of
                        absolutely dismissing the subject of my work from my mind, whenever I
                        please, and the more difficult art of refusing to let any other subject of
                        interest take its place. I do that when I go to bed, and when I do that
                        nothing less than positive physical pain can keep me from going to
                        sleep.</p>
                    <p>I have always been fond of fishing and boating. In summer, at my Lake George
                        cottage, I have a little fleet of small boats moored within twenty paces of
                        my porch-placed writing table. If my mind flags at my work I step into my
                        fishing boat and give an hour or two to a sport that occupies the attention
                        without fatiguing it. If I am seriously perplexed by any work-problem, I
                        take a row-boat, with a pair of eight-foot oars, and go for a ten-mile spin.
                        On my return I find that my problem has completely wrought itself out in my
                        mind without conscious effort on my part.</p>
                    <p>I am fond of flower gardening and, without the least technical skill in it, I
                        usually secure astonishingly good <pb id="VAA2427-353" n="344"/> results.
                        The plants seem to respond generously to my uninstructed but kindly
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>In my infancy my mother taught me to begin every day with a plunge into water
                        as cold as I could get, and I have kept up the habit with the greatest
                        benefit. I find it a perfect tonic as well as a luxurious delight.</p>
                    <p>I have always enforced upon myself two rules with respect to literary style:
                        First, to utter my thought simply and with entire sincerity, and, second,
                        never consciously to write or leave a sentence in such form that even a
                        blundering reader might mistake its meaning.</p>
                    <p>Here let me bring to an end these random recollections of a life which has
                        involved hard work, distressing responsibility, and much of disappointment,
                        but which has been filled from the beginning with that joy of success which
                        is the chief reward of endeavor to every man who loves his work and puts
                        conscience into it.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Norton was the great Sheridan's grand-daughter, beautiful and witty, the
                    author of novels, poems and songs, contesting contemporary popularity with Mrs.
                    Browning; her influence was potent in politics; Meredith undoubtedly had her in
                    mind when he drew "Diana of the Crossways."</p>

                        Perkins has preserved all its romantic charm. . . . Miss Perkins has let
                        letters, and letters unusually interesting, tell much of the story. . . .
                        Indeed her biography has all the sustained interest of the novel, almost the
                        irresistible march of fate of the Greek drama. It is eminently reliable."<hi

                <p rend="center">Translated from the fourth German edition by EDITH LIVERMORE. Large
                    12mo, 318 pp., with portraits and one of Wagner's letters in facsimile. $2.50

                <p>Probably no man ever did more to make Wagner's music dramas known than Angelo
                    Neumann, who, with his famous "Wagner Travelling Theatre," carrying his artists,
                    orchestra, scenery and elaborate mechanical devices, toured Germany, Holland,
                    Belgium, Italy, Austria and Russia, and with another organization gave "The
                    Ring" in London. But the account of this tour, interesting as it is, is not the
                    main feature of his book, which abounds in intimate glimpses of Wagner at
                    rehearsals, at Wahnfried and elsewhere, and tells much of the great conductor,
                    Anton Seidl, so beloved by Americans. Among other striking figures are Nikisch
                    and Muck, both conductors of the Boston Symphony orchestra, Mottl, the Vogls,
                    Von Bulow, Materna, Marianna Brandt, Klafsky, and Reicher-Kindermann.</p>
                <p>It is doubtful if any book gives a more vivid and truthful picture of life and
                    "politics" behind the scenes of various opera houses. Many of the episodes, such
                    as those of a bearded Brynhild, the comedy writer and the horn player and the
                    prince and the Rhinedaughter are decidedly humorous.</p>
                <p>The earlier portions of the book tell of the Leipsic negotiations and
                    performances, the great struggle with Von Hlsen, the royal intendant at Berlin,
                    Bayreuth and "Parsifal." Many of Wagner's letters appear here for the first
                    time.</p>
